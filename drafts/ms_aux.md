## Supplementary Figures

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/01_Spawn_Torgegram.pdf}
\caption{Torgegram describing autocorrelation in spawn timing among flow connected and unconnected locations in the Fraser River basin where lower semivariance indicates lower autocorrelation. The size of the circles are proportional to the number of pairs binned in the given stream distance (Hoef et al. 2014).}

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{*Left* Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) given the observed spawn timing estimates (solid line 1:1). *Right* LOOCV prediction standard error estimate given the observed data.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/03_SpawnRegions.png}
\caption{Climate regions by year among emergence timing prediction sites in the Fraser River basin in British Columbia Canada. Points (green) indicate temperature monitoring locations where emergence timing can be estimated. The ring around temperature monitoring locations are made up of climate divergence estimates (points) for each year between 1970 and 2010 colored by climate divergence groups. Four distinct climate divergence groups are estimated, located in the lower Fraser basin (white), the Nicola and Thompson region (turquoise), the central and northwest region (blue) and the west and northwest region (purple). Boundaries in among groups varies from year to year within edge sites. The river network is colored by mean climate group and watershed is colored by mean annual temperature across years.}

\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/04_MismatchLOOCV.pdf}
\caption{*Left* Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) given the observed overlap between estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom among sites and years in the Fraser River watershed in British Columbia Canada (solid line 1:1). *Right* LOOCV prediction standard error estimate given the observed data.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/05_mismatch_LOOCV.pdf}
\caption{Percent overlap between estuary arrival timing of pink salmon and the zooplankton bloom in the Fraser River estuary in the Straight of Georgia in British Columbia Canada. Colored points represent the observed estimates and are colored by the river distance between the natal stream. Black points represent prediction estimates given leave one out cross validation given equation 4 in the main text.}
