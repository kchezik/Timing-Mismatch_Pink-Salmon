\caption{Climate regions by year among emergence timing prediction sites in the Fraser River basin in British Columbia Canada. Points (green) indicate temperature monitoring locations where emergence timing can be estimated. The ring around monitoring locations are made up of climate divergence estimates (points) for each year between 1970 and 2010 colored by climate divergence group. Four distinct climate divergence groups are estimated, located in the lower Fraser basin (blue), the Nicola and Thompson region (green), the central and northwest region (red) and the west and northwest region (yellow). Climate group boundaries vary from year to year within edge sites. The river network is colored by mean climate group and the Fraser River watershed is colored by mean annual temperature across years.}

\caption{Torgegram describing autocorrelation in spawn timing among flow connected and unconnected locations in the Fraser River basin where lower semivariance indicates higher autocorrelation. The size of the circles are proportional to the number of pairs binned in the given stream distance (Hoef et al. 2014).}

\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/04_sequence.pdf}
\caption{Overlap between pink salmon estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom in the Straight of Georgia from 1968 to 2010. Pink salmon arrival distributions represent populations residing in the lower Fraser River below Hells Gate (blue) and above Hells Gate in the Thompson and Nicola region (green). Zooplankton bloom date range (grey ribbon) is derived from model output in Allen and Wolfe (2013).}

\caption{(\textbf{Left}) Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) given the observed percent overlap between estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom among sites and years in the Fraser River watershed in British Columbia Canada (solid line 1:1).

\includegraphics[width=6.5in]{./99_figures/Aux_Figures/05_mismatch_LOOCV.pdf}
\caption{Percent overlap between juvenile pink salmon arrival and the zooplankton bloom, given how much natal stream climates diverge from the estuary. Colored points describe the overlap and climate divergence estimates for each population in each year data were available and are colored by river distance to the estuary. Black points represent prediction estimates given leave one out cross validation per a fitted equation 4 in the main text.}

\caption{Percent overlap between juvenile pink salmon arrival and the zooplankton bloom, given how correlated natal stream climate is with the estuary. Points describe the overlap and climate correlation for each population in each year data were available and are colored by river distance to the estuary. The shape of the points describes the climatic region of the data as described in Figure S3.}
