#Abstract

##Message Box
There is growing evidence that climate change is driving phenological shifts and disrupting species interactions. However, climate is changing unevenly across space and many animals migrate across great distances and environments. Spatial structuring of populations may influence their vulnerability to phenological mismatch. Here we demonstrate spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish.

#Introduction

Climate change is disrupting the phenological synchrony of ecological interactions (refs). In response to rising global temperatures many species are shifting their habitat range towards the poles and the timing of many life history events towards cooler seasonal temperatures [@Parmesan:2003; @Root:2003]. For instance, of the 677 species assessed by @Parmesan:2003, 62\% exhibited advanced spring life history events while only 9\% suggested spring delays. Despite generally coherent directional shifts in phenology among species the magnitude of change has been variable [@Thackeray:2010; @Thackeray:2016]. Incoherent magnitude shifts in phenology increases the opportunity for mismatch between inter-dependent species [@Cushing:1990; @Durant:2005].

Climate change is occurring unevenly over space [@Bindoff:2013], leaving migratory species particularly vulnerable to mismatch. Environments that closely track each-other provide the opportunity for biota to synchronize, allowing species to take advantage of resources over a greater spatio-temporal range [@Moran:1953; @Royama:2012]. As distance increases so does the likelihood of dissimilar climate shifts, possibly disrupting synchrony with important habitat and resources along migratory routes [@Durant:2007].  Migration timing plays a key role in facilitating synchrony with migratory resources and is largely controled by environmental conditions [@Crozier:2011]. Under climate change, plastic responses to local shifts in the environment can lead to maladjusted arrival timing along the migratory route. Similarly, depending predominately on evlolutionary adaptation may make keeping pace with climate change a challenge [@Crozier:2008]. Migration timing is only one component of phenology. Growth, maturation, reproduction also optimally adapt and respond to their environment. The tension between these different life stages, their relationship with the environment and the mechanisms that govern them interact in complicated ways that must be considered if we are to understand the impacts of climate change on species [@Mangel:2008;@Crozier:2008].
