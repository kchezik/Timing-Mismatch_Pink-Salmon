There is growing evidence that climate change is driving phenological shifts and disrupting species interactions. However, climate is changing unevenly over space leaving migrating animals particularly vulnerable to phenological mismatch. As migration distance increases so do the opportunities for climate-driven mismatch between inter-dependent species, which suggests the spatial structuring of populations influences vulnerability to phenological mismatch. Here we demonstrate spatial structuring of phenological mismatch in a migratory fish.

# Abstract

Climate change may be altering habitats unevenly over space, resulting in phenological mismatch between migratory predators and their prey. The severity of phenological mismatch may increase in migratory species as climates become increasingly dissimilar between origin and destination, which is likely a function of migration distance. Here we consider the relationship between migration distance, climate dissimilarity and consumer-prey mismatch for pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) in the Fraser River, an economically- and culturally-important migratory fish inhabiting the most productive salmon-producing watershed in Canada. Pink salmon are a migratory species that reproduce across climatically- and geomorphically-diverse habitats, and upon emerging swim downstream to a common estuary to feed on zooplankton. Arriving during the zooplankton bloom can increase juvenile salmon growth and survival. We used estimates of zooplankton bloom in the Strait of Georgia, observed and experimental spawn and emergence timing, physical stream temperature and discharge data, to predict pink salmon estuary arrival from 62 sites in 43 years across the Fraser River basin. Stream network models predicted life-history phenology over the river network and uncertainty was propagated throughout the analytical process. We discovered populations residing in the lower Fraser River basin experience more similar climates to that of the estuary, have shorter migration distances and are approximately 1.3 times more likely to arrive during the zooplankton bloom, than more climatically dissimilar populations originating upstream. Spatial structuring of mismatch was also related to the distribution shape of outmigration -- more distant populations had broader distributions reducing the risk of complete mismatch. Increasingly distant populations with more dissimilar climates from that of the estuary had more uniform distributions with limited overlap potential (31% $\rightarrow$ 14%) nearly eliminating the opportunity for complete mismatch. These findings suggest migratory distance and the spatial structuring of climate change are likely key factors controlling vulnerability to phenological match-mismatch.

# Introduction
Climate change is disrupting the phenological synchrony of many ecological interactions [@Durant:2005; @Visser:2012; @Thackeray:2016; @Deacy:2017]. As global temperatures rise many species are shifting the location and timing of life-history events [@Parmesan:2003; @Root:2003]. However, not all species are responding at the same rate thereby decoupling some predator and prey interactions [@Cushing:1990; @Durant:2007; @Thackeray:2016]. For instance, pied flycatcher (*Ficedula hypoleuca*) migration timing is not tracking climate-driven shifts in caterpillar emergence, leading to mismatch in peak predator and prey phenology that is contributing to the observed population decline [@Both:2006]. Thus, climate-change-driven phenological mismatch may pose challenges for predators, including those that are important for human economies and cultures.

Climate-driven changes in phenology do not always result in a phenological mismatch. Whether or not climate change effects species' phenological synchrony depends on the cues that predators and prey use [see 'cue hypothesis', @Visser:2012]. For example species' phenological synchrony is unlikely to be affected when predators and prey use the same environmental cues for their phenology. However, if predators use static cues (e.g., photoperiod) while their prey use dynamic cues (e.g., temperature), changes in temperature are likely to cause phenological mismatch [@Durant:2007; @Visser:2012]. Highly predictable prey phenology leads to tightly coupled predator and prey phenologies with low intra-annual variance (phenological breadth), while unpredictable prey phenology leads to high breadth in predator phenology [@Baker:1978]. Subsequently, predators with higher phenological breadth are at decreased risk for a phenological mismatch [@Durant:2007]. For example, @Mertz:1994 found that cod (*Gadus morhua*) with more extended spawn timing (and thus extended larval emergence) have more consistent recruitment than populations with contracted spawn timing, presumably due to the higher phenology breadth buffering mismatch between cod larva and planktonic prey. Thus, both the type of cue (static/dynamic), as well as the breadth in phenology will influence the vulnerability of predators to a mismatch.

Migratory consumers may be particularly vulnerable to climate-induced mismatches with their prey, as migrants and prey are more likely to depend on different phenological cues [see cue hypothesis, @Visser:2012; @Both:2006, @Visser:2005]. Climate change is occurring unevenly over space with more asynchronous climatic dynamics occurring at greater distances [@Moran:1953], increasing match-mismatch challenges for migrants that travel greater distances [@Durant:2007]. Indeed, @Jones:2010 observed that migrant birds that experience differential warming between breeding and wintering grounds are more likely to become mismatched with prey than migrants whose breeding and wintering grounds were changing at the same rate, an effect that was exacerbated in populations migrating greater distances. We hypothesize that populations inhabiting areas whose climates are similar to their destination habitat will be more phenologically matched than populations from more dissimilar climates. Given the relationship between distance and climate [@Moran:1953], we also predict that longer-distance migrants will be more vulnerable to climate mismatch.

Robust spatially and temporally diverse datasets describing predator and prey phenologies are rare [but see @Burgess:2018], likely explaining why potential spatial structure in match-mismatch is currently understudied. Yet, increasingly powerful spatial models provide an opportunity to leverage datasets with incomplete spatial or temporal coverage of phenology and environmental factors to create predictions of match-mismatch vulnerability across climatically diverse regions. For example, river network models provide a method for describing spatial relationships along a branching network allowing for a more robust statistical approach to the study of connected river systems [@Peterson:2013; @Ver:2010], which could be applied in the study of climate mismatch in migratory fishes in large rivers, such as anadromous salmon (*Oncorhynchus spp*.). Thus, there is an opportunity to use spatial models built on large datasets to provide empirically-based examinations of the hypothesis that long-distance migrants traversing climatically-dissimilar areas will be particularly vulnerable to phenological mismatch.

Anadromous Pacific (*Oncorhynchus spp*.) salmon are one culturally- and economically-important group of migratory consumers challenged by phenological mismatches. Young salmon migrate from freshwaters to the ocean where they rely upon zooplankton prey to grow large quickly, thereby increasing their odds of surviving to adulthood [@Beamish:2001]. Zooplankton feed on phytoplankton whose abundance is dependent on nutrient and light availability near the ocean surface. Due to seasonal patterns in nutrients and light, phytoplankton blooms in mid- to high-latitude regions occur periodically, typically with a large bloom in the spring and a smaller bloom in the fall, subsequently resulting in zooplankton blooms [@Friedland:2017]. Young salmon that migrate into the ocean during peak spring zooplankton bloom have higher growth and survival than salmon that migrate before or after peak prey availability [@Chittenden:2010; @Mortensen:2000; @Scheuerell:2009; @Satterthwaite:2014]. Thus, the productivity of a given salmon population may be determined, in part, by the alignment of their migration phenology and the phenology of their ocean zooplankton prey. Yet, salmon spawn and rear in climatically- and geomorphically-diverse watersheds [@Groot:1991]. Their outmigration phenology is, at least for some species and populations, a plastic trait that is controlled by water temperatures [@Crozier:2008; @Taylor:2008]. Thus, different populations of salmon from different freshwater locations may be differently able to track ocean zooplankton phenology. We hypothesize that climate-driven phenological mismatch with the zooplankton bloom will be exacerbated for far-flung salmon populations from climatically different regions compared with those near the estuary.

There is emerging evidence that salmon migratory phenology is shifting and that climate mismatch may be causing population-level effects. For instance, @Otero:2014 found Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) are outmigrating on average 2.5 days earlier per-decade since 1960 in the North Atlantic Ocean, similar to findings in the North Pacific where @Taylor:2008 observed Alaskan pink salmon (*O. gorbuscha*) outmigrating 5 days earlier per-decade since 1970. These shifts in smolt outmigration appear to be occurring in different salmon species [@Kovach:2012; @Kovach:2013], and are associated with increasing air, river and ocean temperatures [@Taylor:2008]. Increasing sea surface temperatures are also shifting the timing [@Richardson:2008] and abundance [@Boyce:2010] of plankton blooms worldwide [@Friedland:2017]. Although generally zooplankton are reaching peak bloom earlier, in some areas the bloom date has become more erratic [@Allen:2013]. Regardless, the timing of salmon migration may not be tracking the shifting zooplankton bloom dynamics. The degree to which salmon phenology can track inter-annual variation in plankton bloom will likely contribute to which salmon populations are climate winners or climate losers [e.g., @Chittenden:2010; @Malick:2015]. Thus, understanding potential spatial patterns in the risk of climate mismatch is of timely importance.

Here we examine whether there is spatial structure in phenological mismatch in a migratory fish of economic, ecological and cultural importance driven by spatial structure in climate dissimilarity. Locally-adapted salmon populations spawn throughout vast river networks that integrate diverse climate variability [@Chezik:2017], however migrants from all populations face the common challenge of matching up with the zooplankton bloom of a common estuary. Here we ask whether pink salmon populations closer to the estuary, with more similar climates, track inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom better than populations that outmigrate from climatically dissimilar regions that are further upriver. Subsequently, we ask whether synchrony between pink salmon outmigration and their zooplankton prey has changed over time. By linking models that account for the river network spatial structure and propagating uncertainty over multiple life-history events, we estimate match-mismatch potential for 62 sites over four decades (1968-2010) within the most productive salmon watershed in Canada.

# Materials and methods

We estimated juvenile pink salmon estuary arrival timing and phenological mismatch with their zooplankton prey over time for populations throughout the vast Fraser River of British Columbia, Canada. Long-term observational data of juvenile salmon outmigration timing and origin is limited in large rivers such as the Fraser River that contain many salmon populations. Therefore our predictions were based on the following components. First, a model for pink salmon emergence timing was created through a quantitative synthesis of 104 experimental observations in studies from the region. This model was driven by water temperature during incubation and initiated by spawn timing. Pink salmon spawn timing estimates were derived from a fitted stream network model built on 379 unique site-year pink salmon spawn timing observations in the Fraser River watershed. Continuous daily water temperature records available at 62 sites since 1968 resulted 371 unique site-year emergence timing estimates. Thus, we predicted pink salmon emergence throughout the Fraser River watershed between 1970 and 2010, and by adding travel times to these phenologies, created estimates of the phenology of estuary arrival. These predictions of estuary arrival were compared to zooplankton phenology based on a long-term study of phytoplankton. Using these estimates of mismatch, we then asked whether the climate dissimilarity (yearly site-specific difference in climate index) was related to the amount of phenological mismatch, how this was spatially structured, and if the amount of mismatch was changing across years. All components included and propagated uncertainty. Thus, our study was based on observed life history data, environmental data, as well as experimental data. In the forthcoming methods we describe these models' structures, assumptions and limitations, their foundational observational data and our process of linking model estimates, their uncertainties and predictions in unobserved locations.

*Study site*

The Fraser River watershed drains approximately 217,000 km^2^ of diverse terrain and climate (Fig.$~\ref{fig:map}$). Originating in the western Cordillera of North America, the basin drains snow-laden Canadian Rockies and Coastal Mountains. Converging and running down the dry central plateau of British Columbia, the river eventually crashes through the coastal mountains by way of Hells Gate canyon and spills into the Strait of Georgia in the Pacific Ocean. We focus on the Fraser River watershed because the basin is large, topologically diverse, impacted by climate change [e.g., @Kang:2014, @Kang:2016, @Dery:2012, @Schnorbus:2010, @Shrestha:2012, @Healey:2011] and home to hundreds of genetically and geographically distinct populations of five species of Pacific salmon as well as steelhead trout (*O. mykiss*). This salmon biodiversity supports commercial, recreational, and indigenous fisheries [@Nesbitt:2016]. Funneling such a wide diversity of climate and divergent climate shifts to the same ocean outlet [@Chezik:2017; @Moore:2015], salmon populations from throughout the Fraser River basin come from diverse freshwater habitats and yet experience similar ocean conditions.

\end{figure}

*Pink salmon*

The Fraser River basin currently supports annual escapements of 2 to 20 million pink salmon during odd years [@Ricker:1989]. Unlike other Pacific salmon species, juvenile pink salmon migrate out to the ocean almost immediately upon emerging from the gravel. Thus, their migration timing will be largely driven by stream temperatures experienced by incubating eggs as well as the timing of spawning by their parents. There is extensive information on both spawn timing and river temperature from throughout the Fraser River watershed.

Pink salmon populations in the Fraser River are still recovering from a past extirpation event. A rockslide in 1913 in the Hells Gate area of the Fraser River, approximately 200 km upstream of the ocean, blocked migrations of upstream pink salmon populations. Fish passage was reinstated in 1947 [@Roos:1991] with the implementation of fishways. Since then, pink salmon populations have been gradually recolonizing upstream habitats [@Pess:2012]. Given that pink salmon appear to still be recolonizing the Fraser River basin, we included potential locations that do not currently support pink salmon in our study.

*Spawn Timing*

Spawn timing determines when thermal time begins accumulating thereby acting as an adult control on fry emergence and subsequently juvenile estuary arrival timing. Therefore, we must know when spawning occurred in order to estimate emergence. Spawn timing observations were not always coincident in time and space with recorded water temperature records (see below). In order to predict when spawning would occur where water temperature data are available, we built a spatial statistical stream-network linear mixed effects model (SSNM):
 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{S}_{s,t} = \mathbf{X}\pmb{\beta} + \epsilon_{s,t}, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{d} + \mathrm{z}_{t} + \mathrm{z}_{s} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq3},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where spawn date $\mathrm{S}$ at site $s$ in year $t$ is predicted by a matrix of climate and landscape variables $\mathbf{X}$, where the relationship between spawn date and these predictors are described by a vector of $\pmb{\beta}$ coefficients. Residual error ($\epsilon$) is decomposed into multiple random effects ($\mathrm{z}$) to capture the spatial autocovariance between populations. A "tail-down" autocovariance model ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$) describes the relationship among flow unconnected locations along the river network [@Ver:2010]. We used year ($\mathrm{z}_{t}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$) identifiers as random effects to account for year specific variation common across sites and repeated measures at individual sites respectively. The remaining independent and random error is captured in $\mathrm{z}_{nug}$.

We gathered spawn timing data from the nuSEDS database owned and maintained by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). We selected pink salmon observations from throughout the Fraser River basin that included an estimate of the beginning and peak spawn date. To capture variation in spawn timing we assumed the spawning period to be approximated by a normal distribution and sampled distributions for each site and year. Standard deviation ($\sigma$) estimates describing each distribution were approximated by searching for a value where the 99 and 50th percentile closely described the start and peak spawn dates. We sampled these distributions 22 times for each of the 379 unique site-year combinations, resulting in 8734 spawn date estimates at 64 locations in odd years between 1957 and 1998. We limited our sub-sampling to reduce computational complexity and improve model fit times [@Ver:2014].

Temperature has been loosely connected with spawn timing in pink salmon [@Groot:1991] and may contribute to genetic controls on spawning and egg development [@Hebert:1998; @Smoker:1998]. To account for temperature on spawn timing we used Climate WNA [@Wang:2016] to estimate mean fall (September - October) and winter (November - February) air temperature as well as mean fall precipitation at observed and prediction sites. We also included elevation to act as a relative estimate of migration strenuousity and to account for topographic interactions with precipitation. These four climate and landscape variables make up matrix $\mathbf{X}$ in equation $\ref{eq3}$.

We chose a stream network model in part because pink salmon have only recently recolonized much of their historic range and in part because pink salmon have a strong straying tendency relative to other salmon species [@Pess:2012]. Therefore we expect populations that are closer together along the river network to share more genetic information and respond more similarly to abiotic drivers than populations further apart. Accounting for network spatial relationships offers a way of directly addressing straying behaviour thereby reducing uncertainty in our spawn timing predictions.

*Emergence timing model*

Incubation temperatures control the rate of egg growth and development [@Murray:1986], such that if we understand the relationship between temperature and development time, we can predict emergence timing using observed temperature data. In order to account for temperature fluctuations in the natural environment we took a degree-day approach where the accumulation of thermal time since fertilization predicts the timing of emergence. This model is appealing because stream temperature data is widely available throughout the Fraser River basin.

Studies that reported days to emergence during a controlled thermal regime were gathered to build a predictive model for emergence timing. For instance, @Beacham:1986 incubated five stocks of fertilized pink salmon eggs at 4, 8 and 12$\text{\textdegree}$C and recorded the number of days to 50\% emergence. By multiplying the days to emergence by the incubation temperature and summing these values, we get an estimate for the cumulative number of degree-days to emergence for each population under different thermal regimes. Many studies incubated eggs at thermal constants [@Brannon:1987; @Beacham:1988a; @Beacham:1988b; @Murray:1988], while others used variable thermal regimes that mimic seasonal shifts [@Murray:1986; @Beacham:1987]. Temperature accumulation under variable thermal regimes were accounted for provided the details of each studies methods. Our literature search resulted in 104 estimates of cumulative degree-days and days to emergence for 20 pink salmon populations in British Columbia, derived from seven studies.

To describe the relationship between thermal accumulation and days to emergence we used a linear regression model:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	logit(\mathrm{E}_{i}) = b + m\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i} + \eta_{i}, \quad
  \eta_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i})) \label{eq1},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ represents the number of days to emergence at each observation ($i$) and $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ represents cumulative degree days per observation ($i$) given a threshold temperature ($T$) of 0$\text{\textdegree}$C [@Chezik:2014a]. We adjusted $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ by subtracting the mean $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, thereby centering our predictor. To ensure the number of days to emergence didn't extend beyond one year, we logit transformed $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ after scaling the data between 0 and 1 (i.e., dividing by 365). Fitted $m$ and $b$ parameters represent the mean effect of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ on days to emergence and the mean number of days to emergence for the average number of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, respectively. In order to allow for heteroskedasticity in the data we modified our error structure using an exponential variance function:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) = \sigma_E^2 \exp(2\updelta\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) \label{eq2},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we allowed for the variance in our error ($\eta_{i}$) to increase with increasing $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ as defined by the estimated $\updelta$ parameter. This model was fit using RStan 2.16.2 [@Stan:2017] in a Bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. We allowed four chains to burn in 4,000 iterations before sampling every third iteration 1,334 times, resulting in well mixed chains consistent with convergence and autocorrelation plots suggesting independance among samples. We used weakly informative normally distributed priors centered around zero with standard deviations of 1, 0.5 and 1 for $b$, $m$ and $\updelta$ respectively.

*Emergence & arrival timing estimation*

Pink salmon estimated emergence varies within and among populations. To capture parental and developmental contributions to variation in emergence timing we propagated error from our spawn timing model (eq.$\ref{eq3}$) to our emergence timing model (eq.$\ref{eq1}$). Defined by our spawn timing model's predicted mean spawn date and standard error estimates, we sampled prediction site student *t* distributions 1000 times, thereby capturing model uncertainty. Using these spawn date estimates, we then accumulated degree-days ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) and days to emergence, calculating the probability of emergence each day. 

Thermal accumulation ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) was calculated by summing water temperatures greater than 0$\text{\textdegree}$C. Water temperature data were collected throughout the Fraser River basin by multiple agencies and is maintained by DFO in an unpublished database [for more information on temperature data, see @Patterson:2007; @Thompson:2010]. Emergence probability was calculated by estimating $\mathrm{E}_s$ given posterior coefficient estimates of equation $\ref{eq1}$ and calculating the proportion less than or equal to the observed number of days of incubation. We retained emergence date estimates where the probability of emergence was greater than zero and less than one. 

Immediate outmigration by juvenile pink salmon makes their estuary arrival timing a function of emergence timing and river distance [@Neave:1966]. To estimate travel time between each population and the estuary we  divided river distance by flow velocity at the time of emergence. Velocity was calculated by dividing discharge by the product of the rivers width and depth. Discharge and depth estimates were gathered from a flow gauge station in Hope, British Columbia, which is maintained by Environment Canada and made available in the HYDAT database. To estimate river width we used the statistically-derived relationships between discharge, depth and width described in @Moody:2002. We adjusted the intercept parameter that describes the relationship between flow and depth from a mean estimate of 0.27 to 0.52, well within the 95% CI range (0.12-0.63), in order to ensure unknown depth estimates agreed with the observed flow to depth relationship. Time was estimated in days and added to the day of emergence, resulting in distributions of estuary arrival dates for each site and year water temperature data were available.

*Zooplankton bloom, match-mismatch and climate dissimilarity*

Zooplankton are the critical food resource of juvenile pink salmon in the estuary [@Neave:1966]. To determine if our arrival timing estimates coincide with food availability we need to know when past zooplankton abundances peaked. @Allen:2013 developed a model of phytoplankton bloom estimates in the Strait of Georgia initialized with *in situ* observations and predicted by physical and biological observations. Using these modeled bloom date estimates and standard deviations, we estimated zooplankton bloom distributions for each year from 1968 to 2010.

Because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton, we approximated zooplankton bloom by applying a constant two week time lag to phytoplankton peak bloom date estimates [e.g., @Chittenden:2010]. Multiplying the standard deviation around the mean ($\sigma$=5) by three, we estimated a 30 day window capturing the most likely period over which the peak zooplankton bloom occurred. Because the peak bloom error estimate is assumed to be normally distributed, multiplying the standard deviation by three captures 99.6% of the variability around the mean estimate.

To quantify phenological match-mismatch between zooplankton bloom and pink salmon estuary arrival, we calculated the proportion of estimated arrival dates that coincide within the window of zooplankton bloom for a given year. Populations and years with greater overlap demonstrate greater opportunities for growth and survival, as previously documented by @Malick:2015 for pink salmon. 

Ultimately, we wish to test whether similarity of climates between natal streams and the estuary is predictive of match-mismatch. To quantify how well climates across the basin track the estuary we calculated a relative measure of climatic dissimilarity in each year between each site and the estuary. Our climate dissimilarity index consists of calculating the absolute difference in temperature (mean, minimum, maximum) and precipitation (mean) between the estuary and each site, in each month of each year then standardizing these four climatic measures of similarity between zero and one for each spawn year and summing those standardized differences within each site and year. A spawn year spanned between July-01 and June-30 of the subsequent year, capturing direct impacts of climate on developing pink salmon embryos. The smaller the climate dissimilarity index value the greater the similarity between the estuary and the spawn site. Using these index values, we evaluate the relationship between climate similarity and pink salmon estuary arrival match-mismatch.

*Spatial structure of climate dissimilarity and phenological match-mismatch*

We tested the hypothesis that phenological mismatch was related with spatially-structured climate dissimilarity and examined whether there was a shift in predicted phenological mismatch over time. Specifically, to describe underlying trends and the spatial structure of timing mismatch we fit a SSNM:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
logit(\hat{P}_{s,t}) = \mathrm{CD}_{s,t}\beta + \epsilon_{s,t}, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{u} + \mathrm{z}_{t} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq4},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we explained observed phenological match, or overlap, between juvenile estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom ($\hat{P}_{s,t}$) given each populations' natal stream climate dissimilarity ($\mathrm{CD}_{s,t}$) with the estuary. Similar to equation $\ref{eq3}$ our model includes random effects to account for year effects ($\mathrm{z}_{t}$) and the autocovariance among sites in the "tail-up" or flow-connected direction ($\mathrm{z}_{u}$), with remaining error ($\mathrm{z}_{nug}$) assumed to be independent and random. This model enables isolation of the effect of climate dissimilarity while accounting for any residual effect of spatial autocorrelation including distance ($\mathrm{z}_{u}$) with residual random noise captured in ($\mathrm{z}_{nug}$). We logit transformed our overlap estimates ($\hat{P}$) in order to bound the data between 0 and 1. Using this model we predicted overlap given climate dissimilarity at regular intervals along the entire network thereby describing the mean effect in 1970 and 2010. To describe change in overlap (phenological match) over this 40 year period we calculated the difference in our prediction networks for these two years. 

# Results

*Spawn timing spatial patterns*

Modeled estimates suggest spawn timing has been trending later throughout the warming Fraser River basin (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$) and demonstrates spatial patterns in both average timing and shifts in timing. Although our model demonstrated previously known patterns of spawning occurring earlier at higher latitude [@Neave:1966], our SSNM delineated more spatially explicit patterns of spawn timing by climatic region (Figs. $\ref{fig:spawn}$ \& S1). For instance, spawn timing estimates in historically warmer southern-interior locations shifted later between 1970 and 2010 than historically cool locations in the north despite a greater degree of warming in the north (e.g., Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$). Therefore, while shifts in spawn timing among northern and western populations have been limited, populations in the southeast may have shifted by as much as two weeks. Standard error estimates of our predictions suggest the observed shifts in spawn timing may not constitute a significant linear change (Fig. S2). Also, we note that no population currently inhabits the northern portion of the Fraser River basin therefore those predictions are based on the stream network model of spawn timing informed by Climate WNA estimates of temperature and precipitation.

Populations closer on the river network shared more similar spawn timing than those further apart. Although a Torgegram [@Ver:2014] suggested mixed evidence for flow-connected, -unconnected and linear autocorrelation (Fig. S3), when compared in an AIC framework the flow-unconnected network correlation structure outcompeted all other auto-correlation structures and their combinations. In other words, populations appeared more strongly correlated in the upstream direction than along flow-connected stream paths or in directions unconstrained by the network. Overall the random effects in equation $\ref{eq3}$ captured nearly all of the variation in spawn timing with the network ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$), year ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$) effects accounting for 51, 10 and 17% of the observed variation while climate and landscape covariates captured less than 1%. The limited explanatory power of our covariates corroborates the general consensus that abiotic factors are weakly informative of pink salmon spawn timing [@Neave:1966; @Groot:1991].

*Emergence timing model*

Our synthesis of pink salmon incubation experiments confirmed strong relationships between water temperature and emergence timing. Intriguingly, the requisite number of days between fertilization and emergence declined with increasing cumulative degree-days (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$). Therefore, locations with warmer temperatures required more thermal time but fewer days to emerge than cooler environments. For instance, a population experiencing a constant 5$\text{\textdegree}$C incubation temperature is expected to emerge 173 days after fertilization while a warmer 10$\text{\textdegree}$C location is expected to incubate for only 107 days before emerging. Although the time it takes to emerge is nearly double at 5$\text{\textdegree}$C relative to 10$\text{\textdegree}$C, the number of cumulative degree-days is about 20% less. Thus, there is some degree of developmental compensation in emergence timing in pink salmon. Because the rate of degree-day accumulation is highly informative, we can effectively predict emergence timing simply by accumulating water incubation temperatures from the date of spawn.

*Estuary arrival, zooplankton bloom and climate dissimilarity*

There was spatial structure in the predicted breadth and peak of pink salmon estuary arrival. By applying flow informed travel time estimates that ranged between less than a day to ~2 weeks, to thermally-derived emergence predictions (i.e., eq. $\ref{eq1}$), initiated at 1000 normally distributed spawn dates (i.e., eq. $\ref{eq3}$), we predicted estuary arrival distributions at 62 sites across 43 years (1968-2010) (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). As the natal stream climate diverged from that of the estuary, these pink salmon estuary arrival distributions became increasingly uniform, such that each arrival day shared increasingly similar probability (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). Concurrently, arrival distributions tended to be increasingly left skewed, spread over a wider range of dates and arriving predominately after the zooplankton bloom. Conversely, populations and years with relatively small climate dissimilarity values arrived in the estuary over a smaller range of dates, had a defined peak and were relatively well coincident with the zooplankton blooms. Overtime, inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom has increased [@Allen:2013]. Although pink salmon estuary arrival appears to be responsive to different years with different environmental conditions that are associated with differently-timed zooplankton blooms, there is often an overcorrection or a broadening of the distribution towards more uniform arrival (Fig. S4 and S8).

*Phenological match-mismatch*

On average, locations in the Fraser River basin closer to the estuary and whose climate was more similar to the estuary were estimated to have greater pink salmon estuary arrival overlap with the zooplankton bloom (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$ \& $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). For instance, pink salmon in the lower Fraser River basin are twice as likely on average to arrive during peak zooplankton bloom (31% overlap) than hypothetical populations migrating from near the Fraser River headwaters (14% overlap). Moreover, while climatically-similar locations lower in the watershed experienced zooplankton overlap as high as 56%, the least climatically similar regions never expressed overlap estimates greater than 26%. Similarly, the Lower Fraser River was unlikely to have low overlap values with only 6.5% of estimates falling in the lowest quartile compared with 25.2% of Upper Fraser River basin values.

\end{figure}

SSNM mapping (e.g., eq. $\ref{eq4}$) of pink salmon phenological match-mismatch with the zooplankton bloom across time revealed only small-magnitude shifts in the degree of climate mismatch over the last 40 years (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). On average, the outmigration phenology of pink salmon as compared to zooplankton phenology became less similar in the lower Fraser River and main stem while the eastern and northwestern regions became more aligned (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$, $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$, S1). Although our match-mismatch SSNM demonstrated a good fit and strong predictive power, we detected only minor directional shifts of no greater than 1.8% over the 40 years between 1970 and 2010, well within prediction standard error. Model results suggest climate dissimilarity does not capture all the variation (5%), especially among low dissimilarity values. The match-mismatch SSNM was able to capture much of the remaining variation (40%) in the $\mathrm{z}_{u}$ network spatial structure. LOOCV demonstrates that prediction standard error grows with observed overlap but rarely exceeded 15% (Fig. S5) and even captured extreme values extending well beyond the mean estimate (Fig. S6). Thus, while there is strong spatial structure in phenological mismatch in pink salmon, these spatial patterns do not appear to be shifting rapidly through time.

\end{figure}

Pink salmon populations were more likely present nearby if 20% or more of projected estuary arrival timing in the area was coincident with the zooplankton bloom (Fig. $\ref{fig:pa}$). Climate dissimilarity naturally grouped into four regions of the Fraser River (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$, S1) and was strongly predictive of pink salmon presence and absence. The lower Fraser River basin constituted populations below Hells Gate Canyon while the Nicola River and Thompson River basins comprised populations above Hells Gate. A transition or edge region with few observed spawning populations was then evident before reaching the upper Fraser River basin where no known spawning populations currently exist. Thus, there is a regional structure in climate patterns, predictive of pink salmon-zooplankton match-mismatch, which covaries with the presence-absence of pink salmon populations.

# Discussion

Here we discovered spatially-structured climate dissimilarity was linked to phenological mismatch between ocean zooplankton in the Strait of Georgia and migratory pink salmon inhabiting the vast Fraser River watershed in British Columbia, Canada. Based on modeled pink salmon outmigration estimates from 62 locations across 43 years, salmon populations originating close to the estuary are twice as likely to match with their zooplankton prey than those in the farthest reaches of the basin. Using spatial modeling approaches, we created predictive maps of climate-driven phenological mismatch throughout the Fraser River basin (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). Indeed, distant pink salmon populations had more dissimilar climates (*corr* = 0.91 for relationship between distance and climate dissimilarity) from the estuary than more proximal populations. These findings suggest climate may drive strong spatial patterning in mismatch between migratory consumers and their prey, modified by spatial gradients in environmental conditions and phenotypic plasticity. Thus, we provide rare empirical evidence that longer-distant migrants from dissimilar climates may be more vulnerable to match-mismatch.

Large river networks provide spatial structure for both environmental conditions as well as populations [e.g., @Isaak:2014; @Iturbe:2009; @Yeakel:2014]. In a watershed the size of the United Kingdom, we created predictive models of river spawn timing, emergence, and climate-driven mismatch. In more northern and interior locations where the climate is on average cooler (Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$), we found spawn timing was generally earlier (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$) but because of the colder water temperatures during embryo-larval development, pink salmon outmigration was on average 21 days later than their downstream counterparts in coastal, southern British Columbia. By comparison these upstream populations miss the peak abundance of their zooplankton prey more often and by a larger margin (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). Typically river network models are used to predict abiotic variables such as temperature [e.g., @Isaak:2017], here we uniquely apply these models to linked physical and biological dimensions of a watershed to describe the structural architecture of life-history timing and variation. As large river networks like the Fraser River system become increasingly impacted by climate change, local climate manifestations will aggregate downstream [e.g., @Chezik:2017] and confer spatial patterning to the timing and variation of life history thereby organizing climate-driven match-mismatch across the basin.

The phenology of juvenile pink salmon is controlled by the spawn timing of their parents and the temperature of the stream in which they are incubating. We built a robust predictive model of pink salmon emergence timing as a function of stream temperature through a quantitative synthesis of published studies. This synthesis demonstrated that pink salmon exhibit some level of compensatory dynamics in their emergence timing [@Brannon:1987]. While we expected growth and development to scale with temperature [@Brett:1969] such that emergence occurs upon accumulating a fixed number of degree-days, instead we found that individuals emerged faster and slower under cooler and warmer environments respectively, presumably in order to maximize a life history and fitness benefit [@Angilletta:2009]. Such developmental compensation among pink salmon populations may act as an unaccounted-for mechanism to stabilize spring emergence timing despite variable climates thereby increasing the opportunity for juvenile pink salmon to arrive in the estuary during the zooplankton bloom.

Climate change will impact salmon populations through multiple interacting pathways across the salmon life cycle [@Crozier:2008]. For instance, warming temperatures (Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$) may be delaying spawn timing of adult pink salmon by 8.5 days on average throughout the Fraser River basin with interior locations shifting by as much as two weeks (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$). Delayed spawning not only reduces adult salmon exposure to increasingly warm river temperatures but also decreases thermal exposure for embryo development (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$). Warming rivers should drive earlier outmigration of pink salmon, according to the relationship between emergence timing and temperature. Thus, warming rivers would benefit more inland and northern pink salmon populations that currently can't emerge early enough to match their zooplankton prey. Yet, in other locations later adult spawn timing in warming streams may actually keep pink salmon emergence relatively consistent through time. Indeed, there have been little directional shifts in predicted match-mismatch throughout the Fraser River watershed (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). Pink salmon in Alaska have demonstrated micro-evolutionary shifts favoring early out-migration that are hypothesized to be due to warming spring marine environments [@Kovach:2012;@Manhard:2017], and have allowed tracking of the zooplankton bloom which is advancing at a rate of ~14 days per decade in the Gulf of Alaska [@Richardson:2008]. In the Strait of Georgia, directionality of the shifting bloom is less clear, rather the phenology of ocean plankton suggest that the bloom is becoming more variable [@Allen:2013]. The potential tensions between climate impacts on different life stages will govern the population-level impacts of climate change on species [@Crozier:2008; @Mangel:2008]. Previous studies [e.g, @Malick:2015] have found that pink salmon mismatch with zooplankton prey can influence their population productivity. Thus, given our findings here, we speculate that the spatially-structured mismatch that we predict may contribute to differential population dynamics and productivities across Fraser River pink salmon. Indeed, it has proved challenging to connect match-mismatch dynamics with population dynamics [@McLean:2016;@Miller:2010].

It is even possible that climate-driven phenological mismatches may contribute to limiting pink salmon expansion into the upper Fraser River watershed. Currently, despite thermal compensatory egg development (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$), we expect that much of the Fraser River watershed is too cold to promote rapid enough egg development to arrive in the estuary during the zooplankton bloom. By comparing sites in currently inhabited and uninhabited regions, we found overlap with the zooplankton bloom above 20% was strongly indicative of sites near established populations (Fig. $\ref{fig:pa}$). Furthermore, regions of the Fraser River network predicted to have less than 20% overlap with the zooplankton bloom are strongly coincident with cold temperatures (Figs. $\ref{fig:map}$, S1). Thus, cold temperatures towards the headwaters may be one potential factor limiting further expansion of pink salmon. Climate warming of these cold regions, all other things equal, may actually enable pink salmon to have life-cycle phenology that better aligns with the ocean food web. To date, historic pink salmon abundances have yet to be realized since the Hells Gate slide of 1913 [@Pess:2012; @Ricker:1989], hypothesized to be due in part to the loss of large-bodied individuals capable of swimming the extreme canyon flows [@Ricker:1989], and accompanying genetic and phenotypic potential. Although small by historic pre-slide measures, populations above Hells Gate continue to be larger in body size than those populations below the canyon [@Ricker:1989]. Regardless, our research suggests that climate warming is not only providing new challenges for salmon  but also may provide new opportunities in some colder habitats [e.g., @Dunmall:2016; @Nielsen:2013].

We discovered strong spatial structure in the breadth of phenology of pink salmon migration. Specifically, more upstream populations with greater climate dissimilarity from that of the estuary, had broader phenological distributions than more downstream pink salmon populations (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). In this case, the broadening may be proximally driven by population specific non-linear relationships between temperature and development (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$) [@Brett:1969]. The result of this phenological breadth is that upstream populations are buffered from completely missing the peak zooplankton bloom window ($\ref{fig:distrib}$). Thus, spatial structuring of mismatch will not only be driven by spatial patterns in phenological peaks but also spatial patterns of phenological variability [e.g., @Mertz:1994].

Our methods utilized a series of large-datasets and relational analyses to make general predictions on spatial match-mismatch between pink salmon and their estuarine zooplankton prey. We note that our study did not directly observe salmon migration -- Fraser River watershed pink salmon populations are genetically indistinguishable with traditional genetic stock identification approaches [@Holtby:2008], such that reconstructing population-specific historic outmigrations is impossible. To conservatively address and reduce uncertainty in our estuarine arrival predictions we, 1. built our models using large amounts of observational data, 2. propagated uncertainty across life-history events, 3. utilized models that account for structure in correlation and variance, and 4. built life-stage models from first principles which relate the environment to growth and behaviour. This does not mean we have captured all forms of variation, for instance populations may have unaccounted-for locally adapted temperature-emergence relationships, but given the genetic similarity among populations across geographically distinct regions, variation is likely very small. That said, pink salmon are believed to be adjusting to climate change more rapidly than other Pacific salmon species [@Crozier:2015], possibly expressing rapid evolution [@Kovach:2012]. As such we might expect future populations inhabiting currently uninhabited locations to express different life histories in order to cope with local challenges. Ultimately we feel these methods largely capture the underlying processes that describe variation in estuary arrival among populations and fundamentally allows for prediction at unobserved locations extending spatially beyond the observed data.

Here we provide evidence, through a study of an economically- and culturally-important migratory fish, that consumers migrating farther distances can be more vulnerable to phenological mismatches with their prey. Understanding the vulnerability and responses of populations, species, and regions to climate change is a major research direction [e.g., @Comte:2017]. For example, currently climate change envelope models rely heavily on physiological limits of species in their current environment [@Lawler:2011], or their behavioural capacity to cope [e.g., @Sinervo:2010] to extrapolate range limitations in the future. Here we build predictive maps of match-mismatch for a migratory fish, and discovered strong spatial structure such that longer-distance migrants from climatically dissimilar regions are more vulnerable to mismatch with their prey. If climate change further disrupts environmental predictability across space and time, long-distance migrants will increasingly find their phenologies out of sync with their prey. Thus, migratory distance and how it is linked to climate dissimilarity may be a key factor in contributing to climate change vulnerability.
