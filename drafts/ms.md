There is growing evidence that climate change is driving phenological shifts and disrupting species interactions. However, climate is changing unevenly over space leaving migrating animals particularly vulnerable to phenological mismatch. As migration distance increases so do the opportunities for mismatch between inter-dependent species, which suggests the spatial structuring of populations influences vulnerability to phenological mismatch. Here we demonstrate spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish.

# Abstract

Climate change may be changing distant habitats differently, resulting in phenological mismatch between migratory predators and their prey. The severity of phenological mismatch in migratory species should increase as a function of increasingly dissimilar changes in climate between origin and destination, which is likely a function of migration distance. We refer to this prediction as the migration-distance-mismatch hypothesis. We examine this hypothesis for an economically- and culturally-important migratory fish-pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) in the Fraser River, the largest salmon producing watershed in Canada. Pink salmon are a migratory species with local spawning populations that may reproduce across climatically- and geomorphically-diverse watersheds, and upon emerging swim downstream to a common estuary to feed on zooplankton. Arriving during the zooplankton bloom can increase juvenile salmon growth and survival. We used estimates of zooplankton bloom in the Strait of Georgia, observed and experimental spawn and emergence timing, physical stream temperature and discharge data, to predict pink salmon estuary arrival from 62 sites in 43 years across the Fraser River basin. Stream network models predicted life history phenology over the river network and uncertainty was propagated throughout the analytical process. We discovered populations residing in the lower Fraser River basin experience more similar climates to that of the estuary, have shorter migration distances and are approximately 1.3 times more likely to arrive during the zooplankton bloom than populations further upstream. Locations on the Fraser River network with climates most similar to that of the estuary are expected on average to have 31% overlap with the estuary while the most climatically dissimilar are expected to be only 14% coincident with the zooplankton bloom. Thus, pink salmon with longer distance migrations are more vulnerable to phenological mismatches. Migratory distance and the spatial structuring of climate change are likely key factors controlling vulnerability to phenological match-mismatch.

# Introduction

Climate change is disrupting the phenological synchrony of ecological interactions. As global temperatures rise many species are shifting the location and timing of life history events, especially those occurring in the spring [@Parmesan:2003; @Root:2003]. However, not all species are responding at the same rate thereby decoupling some predator and prey interactions [@Cushing:1990; @Durant:2005].

Migratory consumers may be particularly vulnerable to mismatches with their prey [@Visser:2005; @Both:2006]. For instance, pied flycatcher (*Ficedula hypoleuca*) migration timing coincides with historic peak caterpillar abundance [@Both:2006]. Yet, pied flycatcher migration is not tracking climate-driven shifts in caterpillar emergence and the bird populations have been declining [@Both:2006]. The phenology of consumer migration may have evolved to align with the historic average peak resource availability or be controlled by plastic traits that hone to historically-effective environmental predictors of resource phenology in the future habitat [@Crozier:2011; @Baker:1978]. If environmental correlation between the migratory origin and destination is strong, migratory consumers whose phenology is environmentally plastic may be able to successfully align with the phenology of their prey. Yet, under climate change that is expressed differently across space [@Bindoff:2013], long-held spatial environmental correlations may become decoupled, resulting in phenological mismatch.

Although there is general appreciation for climate mismatches and its challenges for migrants [@Durant:2007], there is still limited understanding of the potential for spatial structuring of climate change mismatch. Given more distant habitats are likely to have more asynchronous climatic dynamics [@Moran:1953], we predict that there may be spatial structure to the potential for climate mismatches for migratory consumers. Here we pose the hypothesis that consumers with greater migration distances will have a higher risk of phenological asynchrony with their prey. We call this the migration-distance-mismatch hypothesis. This challenge may be exacerbated in this era of rapid climate change. 

Anadromous Pacific (*Oncorhynchus spp.*) salmon are one culturally- and economically-important group of migratory consumers challenged by climate mismatches. Young salmon migrate from freshwaters to the ocean where they rely upon zooplankton prey to grow large quickly thereby increasing their odds of survival to adulthood [@Beamish:2001]. Zooplankton feed on phytoplankton whose abundance is dependent on nutrient and light availability near the ocean surface. Due to seasonal patterns in nutrients and light, phytoplankton blooms in mid- to high-latitude regions occur periodically, typically with a large bloom in the spring and a smaller bloom in the fall, subsequently resulting in zooplankton blooms [@Friedland:2017]. Young salmon that migrate into the ocean during peak spring zooplankton bloom have higher growth and survival [@Chittenden:2010; @Mortensen:2000; @Scheuerell:2009; @Satterthwaite:2014]. Thus the productivity of a given salmon population may be determined, in part, by the alignment of their migration phenology and the phenology of their ocean zooplankton prey. Yet, salmon spawn and rear in climatically- and geomorphically-diverse watersheds [@Groot:1991]. Their outmigration phenology is, at least for some species and populations, a plastic trait that is controlled by water temperatures [@Crozier:2008; @Taylor:2008]. Thus, different populations of salmon from different freshwater locations may be differently able to track ocean zooplankton phenology. Following the migration-distance mismatch hypothesis, we hypothesize that climate mismatch will be exacerbated for far-flung populations compared with those near the estuary.

There is emerging broad-scale appreciation that salmon migratory phenology is shifting and that climate mismatch may be causing population-level effects. For instance, @Otero:2014 found Atlantic salmon (*Salmo salar*) are outmigrating on average 2.5 days earlier per-decade since 1960 in the North Atlantic Ocean, similar to findings in the North Pacific where @Taylor:2008 observed Alaskan pink salmon (*O. gorbuscha*) outmigrating 5 days earlier per-decade since 1970. These shifts in smolt outmigration appear to be widespread among salmon species [@Kovach:2012; @Kovach:2013], driven primarily by increasing air, river and ocean temperatures [@Taylor:2008]. Increasing sea surface temperatures are also shifting the timing [@Richardson:2008] and abundance [@Boyce:2010] of plankton blooms worldwide [@Friedland:2017]. Although zooplankton are reaching peak bloom earlier, in some areas the bloom date has become more erratic and the rate of advance may not be keeping pace with shifting salmon outmigration [@Edwards:2004]. Tracking the inter-annual variation in plankton bloom despite divergent shifts in climate between local environments and the estuary will contribute to the future success and persistence of some populations over others [e.g., @Chittenden:2010; @Malick:2015]. Thus, understanding potential spatial patterns of risk of climate mismatch is of timely importance.

Here we examine whether there is spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish of economic, ecological and cultural importance. Locally adapted salmon populations spawn throughout vast river networks that integrate diverse climate variability [@Chezik:2017], however migrants from all populations face the common challenge of matching up with the zooplankton bloom of a common estuary. Here we ask whether pink salmon populations closer to the estuary, with more correlated climates, track inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom better than populations that outmigrate from further upriver? Subsequently, we ask whether synchrony between pink salmon outmigration and their zooplankton prey has changed over time and if these changes are spatially organized? By linking models that account for the river network spatial structure and propagating uncertainty over multiple life-history events, we estimate match-mismatch potential for 62 sites over four decades (1968-2010) within the largest salmon watershed in Canada.

# Materials and methods

*Study site*

The Fraser River watershed drains approximately 217,000 km^2^ of diverse terrain and climate (Fig.$~\ref{fig:map}$). Originating in the western Cordillera of North America, the basin drains snow-laden Canadian Rockies and Coastal Mountains. Converging and running down the dry central plateau of British Columbia, the river eventually crashes through the coastal mountains by way of Hells Gate canyon and spills into the Strait of Georgia in the Pacific Ocean. We focus on the Fraser River watershed because the basin is large, topologically diverse, impacted by climate change [e.g., @Kang:2014, @Kang:2016, @Dery:2012, @Schnorbus:2010, @Shrestha:2012, @Healey:2011] and home to hundreds of genetically and geographically distinct populations of five species of Pacific salmon as well as steelhead (*O. Mykiss*). This salmon biodiversity supports commercial, recreational, and indigenous fisheries [@Nesbitt:2016]. Funneling such a wide diversity of climate and divergent climate shifts to the same ocean outlet [@Chezik:2017; @Moore:2015], the Fraser River basin offers strong gradients yet controls for ocean conditions.

\end{figure}

*Pink salmon*

The Fraser River basin currently supports annual escapements of 2 to 20 million pink salmon during odd years [@Ricker:1989]. Unlike other Pacific salmon species, juvenile pink salmon migrate out to the ocean almost immediately upon emerging from the gravel. Thus, their migration timing will be largely driven by stream temperatures experienced by incubating eggs as well as the timing of spawning by their parents. There is extensive information on both spawn timing and river temperature from throughout the Fraser River watershed.

Pink salmon populations in the Fraser River are still recovering from a past extirpation event. A rockslide in 1913 in the Hells Gate area of the Fraser River, approximately 200 km upstream of the ocean, blocked migrations of upstream pink salmon populations. Fish passage was reinstated in 1947 [@Roos:1991] with the implementation of fishways. Since then, pink salmon populations have been gradually recolonizing upstream habitats [@Pess:2012]. Given that pink salmon appear to still be recolonizing the Fraser River basin, we included potential locations that do not currently support pink salmon in our study.

*Emergence timing estimation*

Incubation temperatures control the rate of egg growth and development [@Murray:1986], such that if we understand the relationship between temperature and development time, we can predict emergence timing using observed temperature data. In order to account for temperature fluctuations in the natural environment we took a degree-day approach where the accumulation of thermal time since fertilization predicts the timing of emergence. This model is appealing because stream temperature data is widely available throughout the Fraser River basin.

Studies that reported days to emergence during a controlled thermal regime were gathered to build a predictive model for emergence timing. For instance, @Beacham:1986 incubated five stocks of fertilized pink salmon eggs at 4, 8 and 12$\text{\textdegree}$C and recorded the number of days to 50\% emergence. By multiplying the days to emergence by the incubation temperature and summing these values, we get an estimate for the cumulative number of degree-days to emergence for each population under different thermal regimes. Many studies incubated eggs at thermal constants [@Brannon:1987; @Beacham:1988a; @Beacham:1988b; @Murray:1988], while others used variable thermal regimes that mimic seasonal shifts [@Murray:1986; @Beacham:1987]. Temperature accumulation under variable thermal regimes were accounted for provided the details of each studies methods. Our literature search resulted in 104 estimates of cumulative degree-days and days to emergence for 20 populations in British Columbia, derived from seven studies.

To describe the relationship between thermal accumulation and days to emergence we used a linear regression model:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{E}_{i} = b + m\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i} + \eta_{i}, \quad
  \eta_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i})) \label{eq1},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ represents the number of days to emergence at each observation ($i$) and $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ represents cumulative degree days per observation ($i$) given a threshold temperature ($T$) of 0$\text{\textdegree}$C [@Chezik:2014a]. We adjusted $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ by subtracting the mean $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, thereby centering our predictor. To ensure the number of days to emergence didn't extend beyond one year, we logit transformed $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ after scaling the data between 0 and 1 (i.e., dividing by 365). Fitted $m$ and $b$ parameters represent the mean effect of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ on days to emergence and the mean number of days to emergence for the average number of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, respectively. In order to allow for heteroskedasticity in the data we modified our error structure using an exponential variance function:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) = \sigma_E^2 \exp(2\updelta\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) \label{eq2},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we allowed for the variance in our error ($\eta_{i}$) to increase with increasing $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ as defined by the estimated $\updelta$ parameter. This model was fit using RStan 2.16.2 [@Stan:2017] in a Bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. We allowed four chains to burn in 4,000 iterations before sampling every third iteration 1,334 times, ensuring convergence among chains and independence between samples. We used weakly informative normally distributed priors centered around zero with standard deviations of 1, 0.5 and 1 for $b$, $m$ and $\updelta$ respectively.

*Spawn Timing*

Spawn timing determines when thermal time begins accumulating thereby acting as an adult control on fry emergence and subsequently juvenile estuary arrival timing. Therefore, we must know when spawning occurred in order to estimate emergence. Spawn timing observations are not always coincident in time and space with recorded water temperature records. In order to predict when spawning would occur where water temperature data are available, we built a spatial statistical stream-network linear mixed effects model (SSNM):
 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{S}_{s,t} = \mathrm{X}\beta + \epsilon, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{d} + \mathrm{z}_{y} + \mathrm{z}_{s} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq3},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where spawn date $\mathrm{S}$ at site ($\mathrm{s}$) in year ($\mathrm{t}$) is predicted by a matrix of climate and landscape variables $\mathrm{X}$, where the relationship between spawn date and these predictors are described by a vector of $\beta$ coefficients. Residual error ($\epsilon$) is decomposed into multiple random effects ($\mathrm{z}$) to capture the spatial autocovariance between populations. A "tail-down" autocovariance model ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$) describes the relationship among flow unconnected locations along the river network [@Ver:2010]. We used year ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$) identifiers as random effects to account for year specific variation common across sites and repeated measures at individual sites respectively. The remaining independent and random error is captured in $\mathrm{z}_{nug}$.

Spawn timing data were obtained from the nuSEDS database owned and maintained by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). We selected pink salmon observations from throughout the Fraser River basin that included an estimate of the beginning and peak spawn date. To capture variation in spawn timing we assumed the spawning period to be well-approximated by a normal distribution and sampled distributions for each site and year. Standard deviation (sd) estimates describing each distribution were approximated by searching for a value where the 99 and 50th percentile closely described the start and peak spawn dates. We sampled these distributions 22 times for each of the 379 unique site-year combinations, resulting in 8734 spawn date estimates at 64 locations in odd years between 1957 and 1998. We limited our sub-sampling to reduce computational complexity and improve model fit times [@Ver:2014].

Temperature has been loosely connected with spawn timing in pink salmon [@Groot:1991] and may contribute to genetic controls on spawning and egg development [@Hebert:1998; @Smoker:1998]. To account for temperature on spawn timing we used Climate WNA [@Wang:2016] to estimate mean fall (September - October) and winter (November - February) air temperature as well as mean fall precipitation at observed and prediction sites. We also included elevation to act as a relative estimate of migration strenuousity and to account for topographic interactions with precipitation. These four climate and landscape variables make up matrix $\mathrm{X}$ in equation $\ref{eq3}$.

We chose a stream network model in part because pink salmon have only recently recolonized much of their historic range and in part because pink salmon have a strong straying tendency relative to other salmon species [@Pess:2012]. Therefore we expect populations that are closer together along the river network to share more genetic information and respond more similarly to abiotic drivers than populations further apart. Accounting for network spatial relationships offers a way of directly addressing straying behaviour thereby reducing uncertainty in our spawn timing predictions.

*Emergence & arrival timing estimation*

Pink salmon estimated emergence varies within and among populations. To capture parental and developmental contributions to variation in emergence timing we propagated error from our spawn timing model (eq.$\ref{eq3}$) to our emergence model (eq.$\ref{eq1}$). Defined by our spawn timing model's predicted mean spawn date and standard error estimates, we sampled prediction site t-distributions 1000 times, thereby capturing model uncertainty. Using these spawn date estimates, we then accumulated degree-days ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) and days to emergence, calculating the probability of emergence each day. 

Thermal accumulation ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) was calculated by summing water temperatures greater than 0$\text{\textdegree}$C. Water temperature data were extracted from the Fraser River Freshwater Temperature Database. This database contains freshwater temperature data collected throughout the Fraser River basin by multiple agencies and is maintained by DFO. Emergence probability was calculated by estimating $\mathrm{E}_s$ given posterior coefficient estimates of equation $\ref{eq1}$ and calculating the proportion less than or equal to the observed number of days of incubation. We retained emergence date estimates where the probability of emergence was greater than zero and less than one. 

Immediate outmigration makes estuary arrival timing largely a function of emergence timing and river distance [@Neave:1966]. To estimate travel time between each population and the estuary we  divided river distance by flow velocity at the time of emergence. Velocity was calculated by dividing discharge by the product of the rivers width and depth. Discharge and depth estimates were gathered from a flow gauge station in Hope, British Columbia, which is maintained by Environment Canada and made available in the HYDAT database. To estimate river width we used the statistically derived relationships between discharge, depth and width described in @Moody:2002. We adjusted the intercept parameter that describes the relationship between flow and depth from a mean estimate of 0.27 to 0.52, well within the 95% CI range (0.12-0.63), in order to ensure unknown depth estimates agreed with the observed flow to depth relationship. Time was estimated in days and added to the day of emergence, resulting in distributions of estuary arrival dates for each site and year water temperature data were available.

*Zooplankton bloom, match-mismatch and climate divergence*

Zooplankton are the critical food resource of juvenile pink salmon in the estuary [@Neave:1966]. To determine if our arrival timing estimates coincide with food availability we need to know when past zooplankton abundances peaked. @Allen:2013 developed a model of phytoplankton bloom estimates in the Strait of Georgia initialized with *in situ* observations and predicted by physical and biological observations. Using these modeled bloom date estimates and standard deviations, we estimated zooplankton bloom distributions for each year from 1968 to 2010.

Because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton we approximated zooplankton bloom by applying a constant two week time lag to phytoplankton peak bloom date estimates [e.g., @Chittenden:2010]. Using the standard deviation around the mean we estimated a 30 day window capturing the most likely period over which the peak zooplankton bloom occurred. Because the peak bloom error estimate is assumed to be normally distributed, multiplying the standard deviation by three captures 99.6% of the variability around the mean estimate.

To quantify phenological match-mismatch between zooplankton bloom and pink salmon estuary arrival, we calculated the proportion of estimated arrival dates that coincide within the window of zooplankton bloom for a given year. Populations and years with greater overlap demonstrate greater opportunities for growth and survival, as previously documented by @Malick:2015 for pink salmon. 

Ultimately, we wish to test whether similar and correlative climates between natal streams and the estuary is predictive of match-mismatch. To quantify how well climates across the basin track the estuary we calculated simple Pearson correlation values and a relative measure of climatic dissimilarity in each year between each site and the estuary. Our climate disimilarity index consists of calculating the absolute difference in temperature (mean, minimum, maximum) and precipitation (mean) between the estuary and each site, in each month of each year. We then standardized these four climatic measures of similarity between zero and one for each spawn year and summed those standardized differences within each site and year. A spawn year spanned between July-01 and June-30 of the subsequent year, capturing direct impacts of climate on developing pink salmon embryos. The smaller the index value the greater the similarity between the estuary and the spawn site. Using these correlation and index values, we evaluate the relationship between climate similarity and pink salmon estuary arrival match-mismatch.

*Spatial structure of phenological match-mismatch*

Climate change is shifting the correlation structure of climate over space, therefore we expect the spatial stucture of phenological mismatch to shift as well. To describe underlying trends and the spatial structure of timing mismatch we fit a SSNM:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_{s,t} = \mathrm{CD}_{s,t}\beta + \epsilon, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{u} + \mathrm{z}_{y} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq4},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we explained observed overlap between juvenile estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom ($\hat{P}_{s,t}$) given each populations natal stream climate dissimilarity ($\mathrm{CD}_{s,t}$) with the estuary. Similar to equation $\ref{eq3}$ our model includes random effects to account for year effects ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and the autocovariance among sites in the "tail-up" or flow-connected direction ($\mathrm{z}_{u}$), with remaining error ($\mathrm{z}_{nug}$) assumed to be independent and random. We logit transformed our overlap estimates ($\hat{P}$) in order to bound the data between 0 and 1. Using this model we predicted overlap given climate divergence at regular intervals along the entire network thereby describing the mean effect in 1970 and 2010. To describe mean change in overlap over this 40 year period we calculated the difference in our prediction networks for these two years. 

# Results

*Spawn timing spatial patterns*

Spawn timing has been trending later throughout the Fraser River basin (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$) and demonstrates spatial patterns in both average timing and shifts in timing. Although our model demonstrated previously known patterns of spawning occurring earlier at higher latitude [@Neave:1966], our SSNM delineated more spatially explicit patterns of spawn timing by climatic region (Figs. $\ref{fig:spawn}$ \& S1). For instance, spawn timing estimates in historically hot southern-interior locations shifted later betwen 1970 and 2010 than historically cool locations in the north despite a greater degree of warming (e.g., Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$). Therefore, while shifts in spawn timing among northern and western populations have been limited, populations in the southeast may have shifted by as much as two weeks. Standard error estimates of our predictions suggest the observed shifts in spawn timing may not constitute a significant linear change (Fig. S2). Also, we note that no population currently inhabits the northern portion of the Fraser River basin therefore those predictions are based on the stream network model of spawn timing informed by Climate WNA estimates of temperature and precipitation.

Populations closer on the network shared more similar spawn timing than those further apart. Although a Torgegram [@Ver:2014] suggested mixed evidence for flow-connected, -unconnected and linear autocorrelation (Fig. S3), when compared in an AIC framework the flow-unconnected network correlation structure outcompeted all other auto-correlation structures and their combinations. In other words, populations appeared more strongly correlated in the upstream direction than along flow-connected stream paths or in directions unconstrained by the network. Overall the random effects in equation $\ref{eq3}$ captured nearly all of the variation in spawn timing with the network ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$), year ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$), accounting for 51, 10 and 17% of the observed variation while climate and landscape covariates captured less than 1%. The limited explanatory power of our covariates corroborates the general consensus that abiotic factors are weakly informative of pink salmon spawn timing [@Neave:1966; @Groot:1991].

\label{fig:spawn}
\end{figure}

*Emergence Degree-Day Model*

Our synthesis of pink salmon incubation experiments revealed strong relationships between water temperature and emergence timing. Intriguingly, the requisite number of days between fertilization and emergence declined with increasing cumulative degree-days (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$). Therefore, locations with warmer temperatures required more thermal time but fewer days to emerge than cooler environments. For instance, a population experiencing a constant 5$\text{\textdegree}$C incubation temperature is expected to emerge 173 days after fertilization while a warmer 10$\text{\textdegree}$C location is expected to incubate for only 107 days before emerging. Although the time it takes to emerge is nearly double at 5$\text{\textdegree}$C relative to 10$\text{\textdegree}$C, the number of cumulative degree-days is about 20% less, suggesting thermal time dominates but is not the only factor driving emergence. Because the rate of degree-day accumulation is highly informative, we can effectively predict emergence timing simply by accumulating water incubation temperatures from the date of spawn.

\end{figure}

*Estuary arrival, climate divergence and zooplankton bloom*

By applying flow informed travel time estimates to thermally derived emergence predictions (i.e., eq. $\ref{eq1}$), initiated at 1000 normally distributed spawn dates (i.e., eq. $\ref{eq3}$), we predicted estuary arrival distributions at 62 sites across 43 years (1968-2010) (Fig.$\ref{fig:distrib}$). As the natal stream climate diverged from that of the estuary, these pink salmon estuary arrival distributions became increasingly uniform, such that each arrival day shared increasingly similar probability (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). Concurrently, arrival distributions tended to be increasingly left skewed, spread over a wider range of dates and arriving predominately after the zooplankton bloom. Conversely, populations and years with relatively small climate divergence values arrived in the estuary over a smaller range of dates, had a defined peak and were relatively well coincident with the zooplankton blooms. Overtime, inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom has increased [@Allen:2013]. Although pink salmon estuary arrival appears to be responsive to different years with different envrironmental conditions and differently-timed zooplankton blooms, there is often an overcorrection or a broadening of the distribution towards more uniform arrival (Fig. S4 and S8).

\label{fig:distrib}
\end{figure}

*Phenological match-mismatch*

On average, locations in the Fraser River basin closer to the estuary and whose climate is more similar to the estuary, were estimated to have greater pink salmon estuary arrival overlap with the zooplankton bloom (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$ \& $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). For instance, pink salmon in the lower Fraser River basin are twice as likely on average to arrive during peak zooplankton bloom (31% overlap) than hypothetical populations migrating from near the Fraser River headwaters (14% overlap). Moreover, while climatically similar locations lower in the watershed experienced zooplankton overlap as high as 56%, the least climatically similar regions never expressed overlap estimates greater than 26%. Similarly, the Lower Fraser River was unlikely to have low overlap values with only 6.5% of estimates falling in the lowest quartile compared with 25.2% of Upper Fraser River basin values.

\label{fig:mismatch}
\end{figure}

SSNM mapping (e.g., eq. $\ref{eq4}$) of pink salmon phenological match-mismatch with the zooplankton bloom showed declining differences between the lower and upper Fraser River basin (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). On average overlap in the lower Fraser River and main stem has declined while eastern and northwestern regions improved (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$, $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$, S1). Although our match-mismatch SSNM demonstrated a good fit and strong predictive power, we detected only minor directional shifts of no greater than 1.8% over the 40 years between 1970 and 2010, well within prediction standard error. Model results suggest climate divergence does not capture all the variation (5%), especially among low divergence values. The match-mismatch SSNM was able to capture much of the remaining variation (40%) in the $\mathrm{z}_{u}$ network spatial structure. LOOCV demonstrates that prediction standard error grows with observed overlap but rarely exceeded 15% (Fig. S5) and even captured extreme values extending well beyond the mean estimate (Fig. S6).

Pink salmon populations were more likely present nearby if 20% or more of projected estuary arrival timing in the area was coincident with the zooplankton bloom (Fig. $\ref{fig:pa}$). Climate divergence naturally grouped into four regions of the Fraser River (Figs. $\ref{fig:mismatch}$, S1) and was strongly predictive of pink salmon presence and absence. The lower Fraser River basin constituted populations below Hells Gate Canyon while the Nicola River and Thompson River basins comprised populations above Hells Gate. A transition or edge region with few observed spawning populations was then evident before reaching the upper Fraser River basin where no known spawning populations currently exist. Thus, there is a regional structure in climate patterns, predicted pink salmon-zooplankton match-mismatch, which covaries with the presence-absence of pink salmon populations.

# Discussion

Here we propose the migratory distance mismatch hypothesis and test it in pink salmon inhabiting the vast Fraser River watershed in British Columbia Canada. Based on pink salmon outmigration estimates from 62 locations across 43 years, we discovered that populations originating close to the estuary are twice as likely to match with their zooplankton prey than those in the farthest reaches of the basin. Using spatial modeling approaches, we created predictive maps of climate mismatch throughout the Fraser River basin (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). Indeed, distant pink salmon populations had more dissimilar climates from the estuary than more proximal populations. These findings suggest climate change may drive strong spatial patterning in mismatch between migratory consumers and their prey, modified by spatial gradients in environmental conditions and phenotypic plasticity. Thus, longer-distant migrants may be vulnerable to match-mismatch.

Large river networks provide spatial structure for both environmental conditions as well as populations [e.g., @Isaak:2014; @Iturbe:2009]. In a watershed the size of Switzerland, we created predictive models of river spawn timing, emergence, and climate driven mismatch. In more northern and interior locations where the climate is on average cooler (Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$), we found spawn timing was generally earlier (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$) but because of the colder water temperatures during embryo-larval development, pink salmon outmigration was on average 21 days later than their downstream counterparts in coastal, southern British Columbia. By comparison these upstream populations miss the peak abundance of their zooplankton prey more often and by a larger margin, but surprisingly, because upstream emergence is 60% more variable, they often arrive in more equal proportions before and after the bloom despite later emergence and longer migration distances (Fig. $\ref{fig:distrib}$). Typically river network models are used to predict abiotic varibles such as temperature [e.g., @Isaak:2017], here we uniquely apply these models to linked physical and biological dimensions of a watershed to describe the structural architecture of life history timing and variation. As large river networks like the Fraser River system become increasingly impacted by climate change, local manifestations will aggregate downstream [e.g., @Chezik:2017] and confer spatial patterning to the timing and variation of life history thereby organizing climate driven match-mismatch across the basin.

The phenology of pink salmon is controlled by the spawn timing of their parents and the temperature of the stream in which they are incubating. We built a strong predictive model of pink salmon emergence as a function of stream temperature through a quantitative synthesis of published studies. This synthesis revealed that pink salmon exhibit some level of compensatory dynamics in their emergence timing. Assuming physiological constraints are shared across pink salmon populations, we expect growth and development to scale with temperature [@Brett:1969] such that emergence occurs upon accumulating a fixed number of degree-days. Thermal adaptation is a well documented phenomena [@Hazel:1974], where local climates drive the evolution of populations to grow faster and slower under cooler and warmer environments respectively in order to maximize a life history and fitness benefit [@Angilletta:2009]. Here growth compensation among pink salmon populations may act as a mechanism to stabilize spring emergence timing despite variable climates thereby increasing the opportunty for juvenile pink salmon to arrive in the estuary during the zooplankton bloom.

Climate change will impact salmon populations through multiple interacting pathways across the salmon life cycle [@Crozier:2008]. For instance, warming temperatures (Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$) may be delaying spawn timing of adult pink salmon by 8.5 days on average throughout the Fraser River basin with interior locations shifting by as much as two weeks (Fig. $\ref{fig:spawn}$). Delayed adult migration spawning not only reduces adult salmon exposure to increasingly warm river temperatures but also decreases thermal exposure for embryo development (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$). Warming rivers should drive earlier outmigration of pink salmon, according to the relationship between emergence timing and temperature. Thus, warming rivers would benefit more inland and northern pink salmon populations that currently can't emerge early enough to match their zooplankton prey. Yet, later adult spawn timing in warming streams may actually keep pink salmon emergence relatively consistent through time. Indeed, there have been little directional shifts in match-mismatch throughout the Fraser River watershed (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). While in some locations, zooplankton are blooming earlier [@Richardson:2008] and pink salmon in Alaska have demonstrated micro-evolutionary shifts favoring early out-migration that are hypothesized to be due to warming spring marine environments [@Kovach:2012;@Manhard:2017], here studies of the phenology of ocean plankton suggest that it is becoming more variable rather than directionally shifting [@Allen:2013]. The potential tensions between different life stages, their relationship with the environment and the mechanisms that govern them must be considered together if we are to understand the impacts of climate change on species [@Crozier:2008; @Mangel:2008].

It is possible that climate mismatches may contribute to limiting salmon expansion into the upper Fraser River watershed. Currently, despite thermal compensatory egg development (Fig. $\ref{fig:emerg}$), we expect that much of the Fraser River watershed is too cold to promote rapid enough egg development to arrive in the estuary during the zooplankton bloom. By comparing sites in currently inhabited and uninhabited regions, we found overlap with the zooplankton bloom above 20% was strongly indicative of sites near established populations (Fig. $\ref{fig:pa}$). Furthermore, regions of the Fraser River network predicted to have less than 20% overlap with the zooplankton bloom are strongly coincident with cold temperatures (Figs. $\ref{fig:map}$, S1). Thus, cold temperatures towards the headwaters may be one potential factor limiting further expansion of pink salmon. Climate warming of these cold regions, all other things equal, may actually enable pink salmon to match their outmigration phenology. This is counter to our migratory distance hypothesis. To date, historic pink salmon abundances have yet to be realized [@Pess:2012; @Ricker:1989], hypothesized to be largely due to the loss of large-bodied individuals capable of swimming the extreme canyon flows [@Ricker:1989]. Although small by historic pre-slide measures, populations above Hells Gate continue to be larger in size than those populations below the canyon [@Ricker:1989]. Our work suggests that in the absence of cold adapted populations, climate warming may contribute to the re-establishment and expansion of pink salmon following Hells Gate extirpation. Regardless, our research suggests that climate warming is thus not only providing new challenges for salmon, but also may provide new opportunities for salmon in some colder habitats [e.g., @Dunmall:2016; @Nielsen:2013].

Despite never observing salmon arrive in the estuary, our methods allow us to make general observations on spatial match-mismatch between pink salmon and their estuarine zooplankton prey. Fraser River watershed pink salmon populations are genetically indistinguishable [@Holtby:2008] such that direct observations of outmigration timing is extremly difficult and reconstructing historic outmigrations is impossible. To conservatively address and reduce uncertainty in our estuarine arrival predictions we, 1. built our models using large amounts of observational data, 2. propogated uncertainty across life history events, 3. utilized models that account for structure in correlation and variance, and 4. built life stage models from first principles which relate the environment to growth and behaviour. This does not mean we have captured all forms of variation, for instance pink salmon are believed to be adjusting to climate change more rapidly than other Pacific salmon species [@Crozier:2015], possibly expressing rapid evolution. As such we might expect future populations inhabiting currently uninhabited locations may come to express radically different life histories in order to cope with local challenges. That said, ultimately we feel these methods largely capture the underlying processes that describe variation in estuary arrival among populations and fundamentally allows for prediction at unobserved locations extending spatially beyond the observed data. 

Climate change will shift populations' seasonal constraints, contributing to their climate vulnerability or opportunity but attempting to predict winners and losers will remain difficult and possibly imprudent [@Schindler:2015]. This study demonstrates phenological spatial structuring where pink salmon near the estuary are more likely to arrive coincident with the zooplankton bloom (Fig. $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). These shifts are coincident with climate driven warming (Fig. $\ref{fig:map}$) and increased variability in zooplankton bloom timing [@Allen:2013] but their impact may be spatially specific. Colder locations may be experiencing a benefit from warming while increased zooplankton bloom variability may be negatively impacting lower Fraser River populations where temperatures remain temperate. These spatially explicit and varied impacts on pink salmon synchrony with the zooplankton bloom highlight the complex nature of predicting climate change outcomes on species and populations.

Understanding the vulnerability and responses of populations, species, and regions to climate change is a major research direction [e.g., @Comte:2017]. For example, currently climate change envelope models rely heavily on physiological limits of species in their current environment [@Lawler:2011], or their behavioural capacity to cope [e.g., @Sinervo:2010] to extrapolate range limitations in the future. Here we build spatial maps of match-mismatch for a migratory fish, discovering strong spatial structure such that longer-distance migrants are more vulnerable to mismatch with their prey. If climate change further disrupts environmental predictability aross space and time, we predict that long-distance migrants may be particularly vulnerable to climate change. Thus, the spatial dimension of match-mismatch may be an important contributing factor in considering climate vulnerability.
