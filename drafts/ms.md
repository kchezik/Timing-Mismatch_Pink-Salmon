#Abstract

##Message Box
There is growing evidence that climate change is driving phenological shifts and disrupting species interactions. However, climate is changing unevenly across space and many animals migrate across great distances and environments. Spatial structuring of populations may influence their vulnerability to phenological mismatch. Here we demonstrate spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish.

#Introduction

Climate change is disrupting the phenological synchrony of ecological interactions. As global temperatures rise many species are moving towards the poles and shifting the timing of life history events towards cooler seasonal temperatures [@Parmesan:2003; @Root:2003]. For instance, of the 677 species assessed by @Parmesan:2003, 71\% demonstrated shifting phenologies with 87\% of those exhibiting advanced spring life history events. Despite generally coherent directional shifts in phenology among species the magnitude of change has been variable [@Thackeray:2010; @Thackeray:2016]. Incoherent magnitude shifts in phenology increases the opportunity for mismatch between inter-dependent species [@Cushing:1990; @Durant:2005].

Climate change is occurring unevenly over space [@Bindoff:2013], leaving migratory species particularly vulnerable to mismatch [@Visser:2005]. Environments that closely track each-other provide the opportunity for biota to synchronize, allowing species to take advantage of resources over a greater spatio-temporal range [@Moran:1953; @Royama:2012]. As distance increases so does the likelihood of dissimilar climate shifts, possibly disrupting synchrony with important habitat and resources along migratory routes [@Durant:2007]. Migration timing plays a key role in facilitating synchrony with migratory resources and is largely controled by environmental conditions [@Crozier:2011]. Under climate change, plastic responses to local shifts in the environment can lead to maladjusted arrival timing along the migratory route [e.g., Visser:1998]. Similarly, depending predominately on evolutionary adaptation may make keeping pace with climate change a challenge [@Crozier:2008]. Migration timing is only one component of phenology. All recurring life cycle events (e.g., growth, maturation, reproduction) respond and adapt to the environment. The tension between different life stages, their relationship with the environment and the mechanisms that govern them must be considered together if we are to understand the impacts of climate change on species [@Mangel:2008;@Crozier:2008].

Mismatch has been observed in salmon population dynamics throughout the northern hemisphere. For instance, @Otero:2014 found Atlantic salmon are outmigrating on average 2.5 days earlier per-decade since 1960 in the North Atlantic Ocean, similar to findings in the North Pacific where @Taylor:2008 observed Alaskan pink salmon outmigrating 5 days earlier per-decade since 1970. These shifts in smolt outmigration appear to be widespread among salmon species and suggest rapid microevolution [@Kovach:2012;@Kovach:2013], driven primarily by increasing air, river and ocean temperatures [@Taylor:2008]. Shifts in migration timing impact whether populations arrive in the estuary when zooplankton abundances are high, the foundational food resource for outmigrating juvenile salmon.

Increasing sea surface temperatures are shifting the timing [@Richardson:2008] and abundance [@Boyce:2010] of plankton blooms worldwide. Although zooplankton are reaching peak bloom earlier, bloom date has become more erratic and the rate of advance may not be keeping pace with shifting salmon outmigration [@Edwards:2004]. Arriving when food is plentiful encourages faster growth which improves survival [@Mortensen:2000; @Scheuerell:2009; @Satterthwaite:2014]. Tracking the inter-annual variation in plankton bloom in spite of divergent shifts in climate between local environments and the estuary will contribute to the future success and persistence of some populations over others [e.g., @Chittenden:2010, @Malick:2015]. Thus the climate driven phenological shifts of some salmon populations may be differently able to match climate driven phenological change in the ocean.

Here we examine whether there is spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish of economic, ecological and cultural importance. Locally adapted salmon populations spawn throughout vast river networks that integrate diverse climate variability [@Chezik:2017], however each aims to synchronize with the plankton bloom of a common estuary. By leveraging shared information across a river network and propogating cumulative impacts and uncertainty from the date of spawn through to estuary arrival, we estimate match-mismatch potential for 64 sites within the largest salmon watershed in Canada. Here we test whether populations whose climates are well correlated with the estuary demonstrate increased synchrony with zooplankton bloom. We also examine whether there are changing patterns of synchrony over time as climate change impacts are realized differently over space.

#Materials and methods

The Fraser River watershed drains approximately 217,000 km^2^ of diverse terrain and climate (Fig.$~\ref{fig:map}$). Originating in the western Cordillera of North America, the basin drains snow laiden Canadian Rockies and Coastal Mountains. Converging and running down the dry central plateau of British Columbia, the river eventually crashes through the coastal mountains by way of Hells Gate in the Fraser Canyon and spills into the Georgia Straight of the Pacific Ocean. Home to five species of pacific salmon, the Fraser River basin sustains one of the largest migrations of sockeye [@Eliason:2011] and once large stocks of pink salmon [@Neave:1966]. We focus on the Fraser river basin because the basin is being impacted by climate change [e.g., @Kang:2014; @Kang:2016; @Dery:2012; Schnorbus:2010; Shrestha:2012; Healey:2011], the basin contains pink salmon which exhibit relatively simple and fixed life histories [@Neave:1966], and the basin has been well monitoried such that spawn timing (i.e., nuSEDS), stream temperature, climate monitoring [@Wang:2012], fry emergence [e.g., Beacham:1988] and plankton bloom [@Allen:2013] data are all available. Using these data we estimate when hypothetical populations throughout the basin would be expected to arrive in the estuary, the probability of overlap with zooplankton blooms and the degree to which overlap is a function of climate synchrony with the estuary.
