# Abstract
*Message Box*

There is growing evidence that climate change is driving phenological shifts and disrupting species interactions. However, climate is changing unevenly over space leaving migrating animals particularly vulnerable. As migration distance increases so do the opportunities for mismatch between inter-dependent species, which suggests the spatial structuring of populations influences vulnerability to phenological mismatch. Here we demonstrate spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish.

# Introduction

Climate change is disrupting the phenological synchrony of ecological interactions. As global temperatures rise many species are moving towards the poles and shifting the timing of life history events towards cooler seasonal temperatures [@Parmesan:2003; @Root:2003]. For instance, of the 677 species assessed by @Parmesan:2003, 71\% demonstrated shifting phenologies with 87\% of those exhibiting advanced spring life history events. Despite generally coherent directional shifts in phenology among species the magnitude of change has been variable [@Thackeray:2010; @Thackeray:2016]. Incoherent magnitude shifts in phenology increases the opportunity for mismatch between inter-dependent species such as predators and their prey [@Cushing:1990; @Durant:2005].

Climate change is occurring unevenly over space [@Bindoff:2013], leaving migratory species particularly vulnerable to mismatch [@Visser:2005]. Dependant on resources along their migratory route, species attempt to synchronize their arrival with peak resource pulses [@Moran:1953; @Royama:2012]. For instance, pied flycatchers (*Ficedula hypoleuca*) time their migration to coincide with peak caterpillar abundance [@Both:2006]. Predators such as these either use environmental cues predictive of resource blooms or regular clockwork patterns to achieve synchrony [@Crozier:2011]. In both cases those that arrive at the correct time are more likely to survive and reproduce thereby genetically reinforcing this behavior [@Darwin:1859]. If environmental correlation between the migratory origin and destination is strong, phenological synchrony between species may be more finely resolved. Under climate change, long held spatial correlations may become decoupled, resulting in timing mismatch. Pied flycatcher populations have been declining as they have not been able to track climate driven shifts in caterpillar emergence [@Both:2006]. Although there is general appreciation for climate mismatches and its challenges for migrants [@Durant:2007], there is still limited understanding of the potential for spatial structuring of climate change mismatch. In particular, we expect shifting climate regimes to be less similar with distance but it is unclear whether more distant populations within a migratory species experience increased climate mismatch? 

Juvenile salmon survival depends on synchronizing estuary arrival with the zooplankton bloom but some populations may synchronize better than others. Salmon begin their lives in streams and rivers, migrate to the ocean to grow and return to freshwater as adults to reproduce [@Groot:1991]. Juvenile salmon outmigrate to the ocean in order to grow more quickly but must transition in the estuary from fresh to salt water. This stressful migratory and transitional period is softened by abundant estuarine zooplankton, the foundational food source of juvenile salmon. Zooplankton feed on phytoplankton whose abundance is dependent on nutrient and light availability near the ocean surface. Due to seasonal patterns, phytoplankton blooms occur periodically, subsequently resulting in zooplankton blooms [@Chittenden:2010]. Arriving during these zooplankton blooms encourages growth and greatly improves survival for juvenile salmon [@Mortensen:2000; @Scheuerell:2009; @Satterthwaite:2014]. Natal streams span large, climatically and geomorphically diverse watersheds and because site fidelity is strong, populations locally adapt to a variety of migration challenges [@Groot:1991]. The challenge of synchronizing with the zooplankton bloom may be more difficult for far-flung populations than those near the estuary where environmental cues are more correlative. 

Climate mismatch is causing population-level effects in migratory salmon. For instance, @Otero:2014 found Atlantic salmon are outmigrating on average 2.5 days earlier per-decade since 1960 in the North Atlantic Ocean, similar to findings in the North Pacific where @Taylor:2008 observed Alaskan pink salmon outmigrating 5 days earlier per-decade since 1970. These shifts in smolt outmigration appear to be widespread among salmon species and suggest rapid microevolution [@Kovach:2012;@Kovach:2013], driven primarily by increasing air, river and ocean temperatures [@Taylor:2008]. Increasing sea surface temperatures are also shifting the timing [@Richardson:2008] and abundance [@Boyce:2010] of plankton blooms worldwide. Although zooplankton are reaching peak bloom earlier, bloom date has become more erratic and the rate of advance may not be keeping pace with shifting salmon outmigration [@Edwards:2004]. Tracking the inter-annual variation in plankton bloom in spite of divergent shifts in climate between local environments and the estuary will contribute to the future success and persistence of some populations over others [e.g., @Chittenden:2010, @Malick:2015]. Thus the climate driven phenological shifts of some salmon populations may be differently able to match climate driven phenological change in the ocean.

Here we examine whether there is spatial structuring of phenological asynchrony in a migratory fish of economic, ecological and cultural importance. Locally adapted salmon populations spawn throughout vast river networks that integrate diverse climate variability [@Chezik:2017], however migrants from all populations face the common challenge of matching up with the plankton bloom of a common estuary. Here we ask whether populations closer to the estuary, with more correlative climates, track inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom better than populations outmigrating from further upriver. Subsequently, we ask whether synchrony has changed over time and if these changes are spatially organized. By leveraging models that account for the river network spatial structure and propagating cumulative impacts over multiple life history events, we estimate match-mismatch potential for 64 sites over a 40 year period (1970-2010) within the largest salmon watershed in Canada.

# Materials and methods

*Study site*

The Fraser River watershed drains approximately 217,000 km^2^ of diverse terrain and climate (Fig.$~\ref{fig:map}$). Originating in the western Cordillera of North America, the basin drains snow laden Canadian Rockies and Coastal Mountains. Converging and running down the dry central plateau of British Columbia, the river eventually crashes through the coastal mountains by way of Hells Gate canyon and spills into the Georgia Straight of the Pacific Ocean. We focus on the Fraser River watershed because the basin is large, topologically diverse, impacted by climate change [e.g., @Kang:2014; @Kang:2016; @Dery:2012; Schnorbus:2010; Shrestha:2012; Healey:2011] and home to five species of salmon. Funneling such a wide diversity of climate and divergent climate shifts to the same ocean outlet, the Fraser basin provides the necessary context for testing spatial match-mismatch patterns in salmon.

*Pink salmon*

Although most widely known for sockeye [@Eliason:2011], the Fraser River basin once also sustained large abundances of pink salmon (*Oncorhynchus gorbuscha*) [@Ricker:1989]. Extirpated from much of their original range due to a rockslide in 1913, pink salmon did not begin to recolonize above Hells Gate canyon until fish passage was reinstated in 1947 [@Roos:1991]. Despite extreme mortality in the early 19th century and incomplete recovery to date [@Pess:2012], we chose to focus our study on pink salmon because their life history patterns are relatively invariant [@Neave:1966]. Unlike most pacific salmon species, pink salmon outmigrate almost immediately upon emerging from the gravel. This relatively deterministic life history pattern eliminates significant behavioral uncertainty. Ultimately, by estimating emergence timing and accounting for the river distance to the estuary, variation in pink salmon arrival is largely driven by abiotic factors which have been relatively well monitored in the Fraser River watershed.

*Emergence timing estimation*

Incubation temperatures dominate the rate of egg growth and development [@Murray:1986], such that if we understand the thermal environment we can predict emergence. In order to account for temperature fluctuations in the natural environment we took a degree-day approach where the accumulation of thermal time since fertilization predicts the timing of emergence. This model is appealing because stream temperature data is widely available throughout the Fraser River basin. To describe the relationship between thermal accumulation and days to emergence we used a linear regression model:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{E}_{i} = b + m\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i} + \eta_{i}, \quad
  \eta_{i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i})) \label{eq1},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ represents the number of days to emergence at each observation ($i$) and $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ represents cumulative degree days per observation ($i$) given a threshold temperature ($T$) of 0$\text{\textdegree}$C [@Chezik:2014a]. We adjusted $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}$ by subtracting the mean $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, thereby centering our predictor. To ensure the number of days to emergence didn't extend beyond one year, we logit transformed $\mathrm{E}_{i}$ after scaling the data between 0 and 1 (i.e., dividing by 365). Fitted $m$ and $b$ parameters represent the mean effect of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ on days to emergence and the mean number of days to emergence for the average number of $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$, respectively. In order to allow for heteroskedasticity in the data we modified our error structure using an exponential variance function:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
	f(\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) = \sigma_E^2 \exp(2\updelta\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},i}) \label{eq2},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we allowed for the variance in our error ($\eta_{i}$) to increase with increasing $\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0}}$ as defined by the estimated $\updelta$ parameter. This model was fit using RStan 2.16.2 [@Stan:2017] in a bayesian framework using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. We allowed four chains to burn in 4,000 iterations before sampling every third iteration 1,334 times, ensuring convergence among chains and independence between samples. We used weakly informative normally distributed priors centered around zero with standard deviations of 1, 0.5 and 1 for $b$, $m$ and $\updelta$ respectively.

Data were gathered from studies that reported days to emergence during a controlled thermal regime. For instance, @Beacham:1986 incubated five stocks of fertillized pink salmon eggs at 4, 8 and 12$\text{\textdegree}$C and recorded the number of days to 50\% emergence. By multiplying the days to emergence by the incubation temperature and summing these values, we get an estimate for the cumulative number of degree-days to emergence for each population under differerent thermal regimes. Many studies incubated eggs at thermal constants [@Brannon:1987; @Beacham:1988a; @Beacham:1988b; @Murray:1988], while others used variable thermal regimes that mimic seasonal shifts [@Murray:1986; @Beacham:1987]. Temperature accumulation under variable thermal regimes were accounted for provided the details of each studies methods. Our literature search resulted in 104 estimates of cumulative degree-days and days to emergence for 20 populations in British Columbia, derived from seven studies.

*Spawn Timing*

Spawn timing determines when thermal time begins accumulating thereby acting as an adult control on fry emergence and subsequently jeuvenile estuary arrival timing. Therefore, we must know when spawning occurred in order to estimate emergence. Unfortunately, spawn timing observations are not always coincident in time and space with recorded water temperature records. In order to predict when spawning would occur where water temperature data are available, we built a spatial statistical stream-network linear mixed effects model (SSNM):
 
\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{S}_{s,t} = \mathrm{X}\beta + \epsilon, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{d} + \mathrm{z}_{y} + \mathrm{z}_{s} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq3},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where spawn date $\mathrm{S}$ at site ($\mathrm{s}$) in year ($\mathrm{t}$) is predicted by a matrix of climate and landscape variables $\mathrm{X}$, where the relationship between spawn date and these predictors are described by a vector of $\beta$ coefficients. Residual error ($\epsilon$) is decomposed into multiple random effects ($\mathrm{z}$) to capture the spatial autocovariance between populations. A "tail-down" autocovariance model ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$) describes the relationship among flow unconnected locations along the river network [@Ver:2010]. We used year ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$) identifiers as random effects to account for year specific variation common across sites and repeated measures at individual sites respectively. The remaining independent and random error is captured in $\mathrm{z}_{nug}$.

Spawn timing data were obtained from the nuSEDS database owned and maintained by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO). We selected pink salmon observations from throughout British Columbia that included an estimate of the begining and peak spawn date. To capture variation in spawn timing we assumed the spawning period to be well approximated by a normal distribution and sampled distributions for each site and year. Standard deviation (sd) estimates describing each distribution were approximated by searching for a value where the 99 and 50th percentile closely described the start and peak spawn dates. We sampled these distributions 22 times for each of the 379 unique site-year combinations, resulting in 8734 spawn date estimates at 64 locations between 1957 and 1998. We limited our sub-sampling to reduce computational complexity and improve model fit times [@Ver:2014].

Temperature has been loosely connected with spawn timing in pink salmon [@Groot:1991] and may contribute to genetic controls on spawning and egg development [@Hebert:1998; @Smoker:1998]. To account for temperature on spawn timing we used Climate WNA [@Wang:2016] to estimate mean fall (September - October) and winter (November - February) air temperature as well as mean fall precipitation at observed and prediction sites. We also included elevation to act as a relative estimate of migration distance and to account for topographic interactions with precipitation. These four climate and landscape variables make up matrix $\mathrm{X}$ in equation $\ref{eq3}$.

We chose a stream network model in part because pink salmon have only recently recolonized much of their historic range and in part because pink salmon have a strong straying tendency relative to other salmon species [@Pess:2012]. Therefore we expect populations that are closer together along the river network to share more genetic information and respond more similarly to abiotic drivers than populations further apart. Acounting for network spatial relationships offers a way of directly addressing straying behaviour thereby reducing uncertainty in our spawn timing predictions.

*Emergence & arrival timing estimation*

Pink salmon emergence varies within and among populations. To capture parental and developmental contributions to variation in emergence timing we propogated error from our spawn timing model (eq.$\ref{eq3}$) to our emergence model (eq.$\ref{eq1}$). Defined by our spawn timing model's predicted mean spawn date and standard error estimates, we sampled prediction site t-distributions 1000 times, thereby capturing model uncertainty. Using these spawn date estimates, we then accumulated degree-days ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) and days to emergence, calculating the probability of emergence each day. 

Thermal accumulation ($\mathrm{CDD}_{T_{0},s}$) was calculated by summing water temperatures greater than zero. Water temperature data were extracted from the Fraser River Freshwater Temperature Database. This database contains freshwater temperature data collected througout the Fraser River basin by multiple agencies and is maintained by DFO. Emergence probability was calculated by estimating $\mathrm{E}_s$ given posterior coefficient estimates of equation $\ref{eq1}$ and calculating the proportion less than or equal to the observed number of days of incubation. We retained emergence date estimates where the probability of emergence was greater than zero and less than one. 

Immediate outmigration makes estuary arrival timing largely a function of emergence timing and river distance [@Neave:1966]. To estimate travel time between each population and the estuary we  divided river distance by flow velocity at the time of emergence. Velocity was calculated by dividing discharge by the product of the rivers width and depth. Discharge and depth estimates were gathered from a flow gauge station in Hope, British Columbia, which is maintained by Environment Canada and made available in the HYDAT database. To estimate river width we used the statistically derived relationships between discharge, depth and width described in @Moody:2002. We adjusted the intercept parameter that describes the relationship between flow and depth from a mean estimate of 0.27 to 0.52, well within the 95% CI range (0.12-0.63), in order ensure unknown depth estimates agreed with the observed flow to depth relationship. Time was estimated in days and added to the day of emergence, resulting in distributions of estuary arrival dates for each site and year water temperature data were available.

*Zooplankton bloom, match-mismatch and climate divergence*

Zooplankton are the the ultimate food source of juvenile salmon in the estuary. To determine if our arrival timing estimates coincide with food availability we need to know when past zooplankton abundances peaked. @Allen:2013 developed a model of phytoplankton bloom estimates in the Georgia Straight initialized with *in situ* observations and predicted by physical and biological observations. Using these modeled bloom date estimates and standard deviations, we estimated zooplankton bloom distributions for each year from 1968 to 2010.

Zooplankton blooms are less defined by a single period but rather a punctuated series of blooms. To optimally benefit, salmon should arrive during the initial zooplankton bloom and feed across subsequent blooms. Because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton we approximated zooplankton bloom by applying a constant two week time lag to phytoplankton peak bloom date estimates [e.g., @Chittenden:2010]. A zooplankton bloom window, capturing uncertainty in the phytoplankton model, was calculated by multiplying the standard deviation estimate by three. This 30 day zooplankton bloom window captures 99.6% of the variability around the mean estimate.

To quantify phenological match-mismatch between zooplankton bloom and pink salmon estuary arrival, we calculated the proportion of estimated arrival dates that coincide within the window of zooplankton bloom for a given year. Populations and years with greater overlap demonstrate greater opportunities for growth and survival. 

Ultimately, we wish to test whether correlative climates between natal streams and the estuary is predictive of match-mismatch. To quantify how well climates across the basin track the estuary we developed a relative measure of climatic dissimilarity in each year between each site and the estuary. Our index consists of calculating the absolute difference in temperature (mean, minimum, maximum) and precipitation (mean) between the estuary and each site, in each month of each year. We then standardized these four climatic measures of similarity between zero and one for each spawn year and summed those standardized differences within each site and year. A spawn year spanned between July-01 and June-30 of the subsequent year, capturing direct impacts of climate on developing pink salmon embryos. The smaller the index value the greater the similarity between the estuary and the spawn site. Using these index values, we evaluate the relationship between climate similarity and pink salmon estuary arrival match-mismatch.

*Spatial structure of phenological match-mismatch*

Climate change is shifting the correlation structure of climate over space, therefore we expect the spatial stucture of phenological mismatch to shift as well. To describe underlying trends and the spatial structure of timing mismatch we fit a SSNM:

\begin{linenomath*}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{P}_{s,t} = \mathrm{CD}_{s,t}\beta + \epsilon, \quad
\epsilon \sim \mathrm{z}_{u} + \mathrm{z}_{y} + \mathrm{z}_{nug} \label{eq4},
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

where we explained observed overlap between juvenile estuary arrival and zooplankton bloom $\mathrm{P}_{s,t}$ given each populations natal stream climate dissimilarity $\mathrm{CD}_{s,t}$ with the estuary. Similar to equation $\ref{eq3}$ our model includes random effects to account for year effects ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and the autocovariance among sites in the "tail-up" or flow-connected direction ($\mathrm{z}_{u}$), with remaining error ($\mathrm{z}_{nug}$) assummed to be independant and random. We logit transformed our overlap observations ($\mathrm{P}$) in order to bound the data between 0 and 1. Using this model we predicted overlap given climate divergence at regular intervals along the entire network therby describing the mean effect in 1970 and 2010. To describe mean change in overlap over this 40 year period we calculated the difference in our prediction networks for these two years. 

# Results

*Spawn timing spatial patterns*

Spawn timing has been trending later throughout the Fraser River basin (Figure $\ref{fig:spawn}$) and demonstrates spatial patterns in both timing and apparent shifts. Although our model demonstrated previously known patterns of spawning occuring earlier at higher latitude [@Neave:1966], our SSNM delineated more spatially explicit patterns by climatic region (Figure $\ref{fig:spawn}$, Sup. Figure 3). For instance, historically hot interior locations were more responsive to subsequent warming despite a greater magnitude of warming in historically cool locations (Figure $\ref{fig:map}$). Therefore, while shifts in spawn timing among northern and western populations have been limited, populations in the southeast may have shifted by as much as two weeks. Standard error estimates of our predictions suggest the observed shifts in spawn timing are within expected variation and may not constitute a significant change (Sup. Figure 2). Also, we note that no population currently inhabits the northern portion of the Fraser River basin therefore those predictions are beyond the scope of the data. 

Populations closer on the network shared more similar spawn timing than those further apart. Although a Torgegram [@Ver:2014] suggested mixed evidence for flow-connected, -unconnected and linear autocorrelation (Sup. Figure 1), when compared in an AIC framework the flow-unconnected network correlation structure outcompeted all other auto-correlation structures and their combinations. In other words, populations appeared more strongly coorelated in the upstream direction than along flow-connnected stream paths or in directions unconstrained by the network. Overall the random effects in equation $\ref{eq3}$ captured nearly all of the variation in spawn timing with the network ($\mathrm{z}_{d}$), year ($\mathrm{z}_{y}$) and site ($\mathrm{z}_{s}$), accounting for 51, 10 and 17% of the observed variation while climate and landscape covariates captured less than 1%. The limited explanatory power of our covariates corroborates the general concensus that abiotic factors are weakly informative of pink salmon spawn timing [@Neave:1966; @Groot:1991].

\end{figure}

*Emergence DD-Model*

The requisite number of days between fertilization and emergence declined with increasing cumulative degree-days (Figure $\ref{fig:emerg}$). Therefore, locations with warmer temperatures required more thermal time but fewer days to emerge than cooler environments. For instance, a population experiencing a constant 5$\text{\textdegree}$C incubation temperature is expected to emerge 173 days after fertilzation while a warmer 10$\text{\textdegree}$C location is expected to incubate for only 107 days before emerging. Although the time it takes to emerge is nearly double at 5$\text{\textdegree}$C relative to 10$\text{\textdegree}$C, the number of cumulative degree-days is about 20% less, suggesting thermal time dominates but is not the only factor driving emergence.

\label{fig:emerg}
\end{figure}

*Estuary arrival, climate divergence and zooplankton bloom*

As natal stream climate diverged from that of the estuary, pink salmon arrival distributions became increasingly uniform, such that each arrival day shared increasingly similar probability (Figure $\ref{fig:distrib}$). Concurrently, arrival distributions tended to be increasingly left skewed, spread over a wider range of dates and arriving predominately after the zooplankton bloom. Conversely, populations with relatively small climate divergence values arrived in the estuary over a smaller range of dates, had a defined peak and were relatively well coincident with the zooplankton blooms. Overtime, inter-annual variation in zooplankton bloom has increased [@Allen:2013]. Although estuary arrival appears to adjust, there is often an overcorrection or a broadening of the distribution towards more uniform arrival (Figure $\ref{fig:seq}$).

Zooplankton bloom date range (grey ribbon) is derived from model output in Allen and Wolfe (2013).}
\label{fig:seq}
\end{figure}

*Phenological match-mismatch*

Estuary arrival overlap with the zooplankton bloom decreased with increasing climate divergence from the estuary (Figure $\ref{fig:mismatch}$). Although climate divergence was not perfectly predictive of zooplankton bloom overlap, the strongest overlap estimates among climatically similar locations were more than twice those among the most climatically divergent. Similarly, climate similar locations were less likely to have lower overlap values and never missed the zooplankton bloom completely while zero and near zero overlap were more prominant among increasingly climate divergent locations.

River distance from the estuary was strongly preditive of climate divergence and subsequently predictive of zooplankton bloom overlap (Figures $\ref{fig:mismatch}$ & $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). Although climate divergence does not capture all the variation (5%), especially among low divergence values, the match-mismatch SSNM was able to capture much of the remaining variation (40%) in the $\mathrm{z}_{u}$ network spatial structure. LOOCV demonstrates that prediction standard error grows with observed overlap but never exceeds 15% (Sup. Figure 4) and even captures extreme values extending well beyond the mean estimate (Sup. Figure 5).

\label{fig:mismatch}
\end{figure}

On average phenological overlap is predicted to be greater as populations get closer to the estuary (Figure $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). Stream temperature profiles and climate divergence estimates in the northwest region of the Fraser River watershed predict on average 1/3 the overlap (10%) of those near the estuary (30%). Differences between these two regions have been declining between 1970 and 2010 (Figure $\ref{fig:chgmatch}$). On average overlap in the lower Fraser and mainstem has declined while eastern and northwestern regions improved. No location has changed by more than 1.8%, well within prediction standard error estimates.

# Discussion

*Spatial structure of spawn timing shifts*

*Plasticity*

*Evolutionary pressure*

<!--

Similarly, depending predominately on evolutionary adaptation may make keeping pace with climate change a challenge [@Crozier:2008]. Migration timing is only one component of phenology. All recurring life cycle events (e.g., growth, maturation, reproduction) respond and adapt to the environment. The tension between different life stages, their relationship with the environment and the mechanisms that govern them must be considered together if we are to understand the impacts of climate change on species [@Mangel:2008;@Crozier:2008].
