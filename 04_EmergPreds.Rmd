```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This code takes a bit over two days to complete on my personal laptop.

```{r}
library(tidyverse);library(lubridate);library(multidplyr)
#Read in temperature data.
temp = read_rds("Data_01_Temperature.rds")
#Read in spawn timing prediction data.
spawn = read_rds("Data_02_EstSpawnDate.rds")
#Add a date column with 100 days added to re-adjust spawn date estimates back towards the fall.
spawn$date = ymd(strptime(paste(as.character(spawn$year), as.character(spawn$spawn)), format="%Y %j")) + 100
#Add unique identifier to spawn dates for later reference.
spawn$iid = as.numeric(row.names(spawn))
#Read in emergence model.
load("stanMod.RData")
#Gather all coefficient estimates.
pstrr = as.data.frame(fit)
```

#Algorithm Sudo-code.

1. Accumulate degree-days above 0C and accumulate the number of days that have passed concurrently.

2. On each day, use the number of degree-days that have passed to determine the probability that emergence may have occurred given the number of days that have passed using the Bayesian degree-day model.
	a. Select days with a likelihood of emergence greater than 0 and less than 100.
	b. Plotted by site and year, density distributions of emergence day should represent the variability in emergence timing based on the variability of spawn timing and uncertainty in the DD emergence model. The mean value represents the expected day of emergence and the values around it should demonstrate our uncertainty around that value.
	
```{r}
mung = function(id, dt, tempDF){
	#Subset data by geolocid.
	Tdf = tempDF %>% filter(geolocid == id)
	#Test to make sure the date provided exists in the subset temperature dataset.
	if(any(dt == Tdf$date)){
		#Filter by dates greater than and equal to the date provided.
		Tdf = Tdf %>% filter(date >= dt) %>% arrange(date)
		#Determine the date when days become non-consecutive.
		cc = diff(Tdf$date);
		#Check if the first date that is non-consecutive is not the starting date.
		if(min(which(cc!=1))>1){
			#Set the end date either as 365 days after spawn or the first non-consecutive day.
			if(sum(cc!=1)==0) end = ymd(dt) + 365
			else if(min(which(cc!=1))>365) end = ymd(dt) + 365

	if(is.null(df)) NULL #If the data frame is NULL, return NULL.

		#Estimate the probability of emergence on x number of days since spawn, ...
		# ... given the observed number of degree-days.
		out = map2(df$DD0, df$CumDay, function(x, y, mod = modDF, center = adjust){
			mean = mod$b0 + mod$b1 * (x-center) #All mean 'days to emergence estimates'.
			prob = mean(pnorm(q = boot::logit(y/365), mean = mean, sd = mod$sigma)) #Probability of emergence.
			data_frame(DD0=x, CumDay = y, ProbEmerg = round(prob, 3)) #Hold in dataframe with reference values ...
		}) %>% do.call("rbind",.)
		#If there are days with an emergence probability greater than 0 then return a df. Otherwise return NULL.
		if(any(out$ProbEmerg>0)) {
			out = out %>% filter(ProbEmerg > 0, ProbEmerg<1)

```

#Note

Spawn dates were sampled with replacement so some days will be sampled more frequently than others. This will increase the prevalence of values that are more likely to have been the spawn date and down weight emergence days with unlikely spawn dates. I'm not sure if this makes perfect sense given that sampling without replacement would have still led to days of high likelihood to be more prevalent than days of low likelihood. Could be a big waste of processing time, does it artificially increase our certainty or represent the true level of certainty?
